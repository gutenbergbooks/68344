<h3>
INTRODUCTION.
</h3>

<p>
The only apology which I offer for this authentic
account of an event which (having occurred more than
forty years ago), can scarcely be supposed to possess much
interest for the reader of to-day, is, that having been a
participant in the battle myself, I feel a sort of pride in
having an accurate and complete account of it handed down to
posterity.
</p>

<p>
In my humble judgment no such account has ever yet
appeared; and although I am but indifferently equipped
for the task&mdash;having dabbled but slightly in literature,
during my busy life of three score and ten years,&mdash;yet I
trust that my earnest desire to relate the facts just as they
occurred&mdash;and which I propose to do, without fear or
favor&mdash;will atone for any shortcomings from a purely
literary point of view.  Although I have said that no accurate
and complete narrative of this occurrence has ever been
published, the reader must not therefore assume that there
exist no published accounts of it whatever.  On the
contrary, it has been described more or less at length, by so
many different writers, both in transitory and permanent
form, that my chief embarrassment arises rather from a
superabundance than from a paucity of materials.
</p>

<p>
In the library of the N.Y. Historical Society are to be
found no less than ninety-seven books and pamphlets
giving what purport to be "full, true and particular" accounts
of the attack upon New York by the British fleet in the
year 1890.
</p>

<p>
The titles of some of these contributions to contemporaneous
history are decidedly amusing and suggestive of
the sensational spirit which was such a marked characteristic
of the general literature, and especially of the newspaper
press of that period.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we have among them, "The New
Armada;" "The British Blackmailer;" "Modern Piracy;"
"The Doom of the Iron Clads;" "The Disappearance of
the British flag from North America;" and one, more
pretentious than the rest, is entitled "An inquiry into the
causes which led to the acquisition of Canada by the United
States of America."
</p>

<p>
In addition to these numerous books and pamphlets, the
newspapers of the period contained page after page of the
most vivid and sensational accounts, in which truth and
falsehood, and sense and absurdity, are so evidently mingled,
that no conscientious historian would be willing to utilize
them as reliable authorities.  Nevertheless, a perusal of
them even at this late day, may be found interesting to
many of my readers, and as they are kept on file in most
of the leading city libraries, they are within easy reach of
all.
</p>

<p>
The reader of to-day will be vastly amused in looking
over these old journals, at the evidences to be found on
every page, and in almost every column, of intense and
bitter rivalry and jealousy between their several editors and
proprietors.  Indeed the journalistic world at that period
seems to have been suffering from an absolute epidemic of
sensationalism, which extended not only to the reading
matter, but to the "make up" as well; and in addition to
the prurient details of social scandals, divorce proceedings,
and horrible crimes, the reader's attention was sought to be
attracted by glaring and suggestive head lines, such as would
be tolerated in no respectable metropolitan journal of the
present day.  As an evidence of how our tastes are influenced
by our surroundings, I may here state, that while I
am now shocked at the total lack of good taste and the
superabundance of sensational vulgarity displayed by most
of the newspapers of that day, yet I cannot remember that
I regarded them with any such feelings at that time,
although I was a man, and certainly is competent a judge
of propriety then, as I am now.  But this is to be a history,
not a moral treatise.
</p>

<p>
With such a mass of material at my command, it will
be apparent that it has been no slight task to sift out the
grain from the chaff, and to condense the vast accumulation
of authorities into a comparatively brief volume like
this.
</p>

<p>
I am fully aware that there are many defects in it, both
of omission and commission; but of one thing the reader
may rest assured.
</p>

<p>
I have at least been conscientious in my efforts to get at
the exact truth, and to correct numerous errors which
previous historians have made, either through carelessness,
prejudice, or willfulness.
</p>

<p>
With this brief introduction, and with extreme diffidence,
I submit my work to the consideration of the candid,
unprejudiced, and I trust, kindly disposed reader.

CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE UNITED STATES PRIOR TO 1890.
</h3>

<p>
Before entering upon a detailed account of what naval
experts of all nationalities have conceded to be the most
interesting and important naval event of that remarkable
century (the nineteenth), whose later years many of my
older readers can doubtless remember, I will endeavor to
present in as brief and concise a manner as possible, a
summary of the events which preceded it, and the causes
which led up to it; as without such an explanation the
story of the battle itself would possess little or no historical
value.
</p>

<p>
The first thing which it is necessary for me to explain,
is my reason for choosing the title "<i>The Battle of the
Swash</i>."
</p>

<p>
I am not aware that this title has ever been used before,
but if the reader will consult a chart of the Harbor of New
York, he will at once see the propriety of it.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that what is known among pilots as the
"Swash," is a straight channel, forming a sort of a
hypotenuse to the two sides of the main ship channel, which
bends almost at a right angle at the Southwest spit.
</p>

<p>
Assuming, therefore, that the Narrows is effectually
blockaded with torpedoes or other obstructions, and that
an attacking fleet desired to bombard New York at long
range, and at the same time be in a position to withdraw
easily and quickly in case of repulse or accident, the Swash
Channel is the point which would naturally be chosen.
The British Admiral was undoubtedly familiar with the
upper and lower Bays of New York, and therefore it is not
at all strange that he selected this spot as a base of his
operations against the city.
</p>

<p>
Here he anchored his fleet; and here the battle&mdash;such
as it was&mdash;was fought.  I therefore claim that the title
which I have chosen, is a most appropriate one; and if this
little work is to possess any value as a historical authority,
the remarkable contest herein recorded, will be known to
future generations as "The Battle of the Swash."
</p>

<p>
Having thus "made my title clear," I will endeavor to
summarize briefly the events, which either directly or
remotely, contributed to the final catastrophe, and induced
Canada to declare war against the United States.
</p>

<p>
And here at the very outset of my task, I am confronted
with greater difficulties than at any other portion of it.
</p>

<p>
Our ancestors of the Nineteenth Century were so
constantly occupied in making history, that they seemed to
have little or no time to record it; and therefore there will
probably never be any adequate historical record of the
settlement, improvement and development of the vast
continent of North America.  I regard this as in a measure a
calamity to the whole human race; for I think that history
may be searched in vain for any such grand and marvelous
example of progress and development, as that exhibited by
our ancestors of the last century.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of this dearth of detailed information,
I have been obliged to rely upon such data as could be
collected from the files of newspapers, magazines and
similar publications, for the following meagre sketch of the
industrial and political condition of the United States
previous to the year 1890.
</p>

<p>
What has been called the "War of the Rebellion"
occurred in the years 1861-5 inclusive; and was an attempt
by the southern slave holding States, to secede from the
Union, and establish a separate confederacy, based upon
Free Trade and Human Slavery.  Although the rights of
the slaveholders were fully acknowledged by the law of the
land, yet the growth of the sentiment in favor of abolition
of slavery was so rapid throughout the Northern States, that
the Southerners became alarmed lest their property rights
should be ignored and denied; and after several years of
defiant wrangling and threatening, at length formally
seceded from the Union, and by the attack on Fort
Sumter&mdash;a fort in Charleston Harbor&mdash;inaugurated the
long and bloody conflict which finally resulted in the total
abolition of slavery, and the restoration of the authority of
the United States Government, in all portions of United
States territory.
</p>

<p>
Previous to this war, the United States occupied a front
rank among the maritime powers of the world.
</p>

<p>
The "American Clipper Ships" (vessels propelled
entirely by sail power; which for purposes of ocean navigation
is now practically obsolete) were considered the perfection
of marine architecture, and bore the stars and stripes
proudly and triumphantly upon every sea.
</p>

<p>
Over 2000 establishments were engaged in the
shipbuilding industry, giving employment to over 20,000
skilled laborers, whose wages amounted to more than
$12,000,000 annually; and who built from $30,000,000 to
$40,000,000 worth of vessels each year.
</p>

<p>
During the ten years immediately preceding the "War
of the Rebellion," 67 per cent. of the vessels entering the
ports of the United States, carried the American flag; as
against 33 per cent. carrying foreign flags.
</p>

<p>
In 1887 only about 15 per cent. were American, as
against 85 per cent. foreign.
</p>

<p>
Several causes had conspired to bring about this vast
and disastrous decline in American ownership.
</p>

<p>
The first, and most effective of these, unquestionably
grew out of the almost unconcealed and anxious efforts of
England, to prevent the Northern States from bringing the
war to a successful issue, and thus assuring the restoration
of the Union.
</p>

<p>
The cause of this <i>animus</i> on the part of England, was,
as is always the case, where any of her interests are involved,
a purely and intensely selfish one.
</p>

<p>
The Northern, and especially the New England States,
were mercantile and manufacturing States, and had become
formidable rivals to England in the two great interests in
which the latter power had hitherto deemed herself
unapproachable.  The American shipowner outsailed and
underbid his English competitor in all parts of the world; and
the American manufacturer, by improved methods and
ingenious mechanical appliances, had begun to successfully
compete with his English rival, not only in American
markets, but in foreign ones as well; and Englishmen
viewed with unconcealed dismay, the imminent prospect of
having their immense carrying trade as well as their
enormous manufacturing interests, ruined by the competition of
their enterprising and ingenious American rivals.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, so marked had this development been, that an
eminent French writer, De Tocqueville, in a book called
"Democracy in America," written nearly twenty years
previous to the outbreak of the "War of the Rebellion," in
a chapter entitled "Some considerations on the causes of
the Commercial prosperity of the United States," wrote as
follows:
</p>

<p>
"The inhabitants of the United States constitute a great
civilized people, which fortune has placed in the midst of
an uncultivated country, at a distance of three thousand
miles from the central point of civilization.  America
consequently stands in daily need of Europe.  The Americans
will, no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or
manufacturing at home, most of the articles which they require;
but the two continents can never be independent of each
other, so numerous are the natural ties between their wants,
their ideas, their habits, and their manners.  The Union
has peculiar commodities which have now become necessary
to us, as they cannot be cultivated, or can be raised only at
an enormous expense, upon the soil of Europe.  The Americans
consume only a small portion of this produce, and they
are willing to sell us the rest.  Europe is therefore the market
of America, as America is the market of Europe; and maritime
commerce is no less necessary to enable the inhabitants
of the United States to transport their raw materials to the
ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply them with
our manufactured produce.
</p>

<p>
"The United States must therefore either furnish much
business to other maritime nations, even if they should
themselves renounce commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico
have hitherto done, or they must become one of the first
maritime powers of the globe.
</p>

<p>
"The Anglo-Americans have always displayed a decided
taste for the sea.  The Declaration of Independence by
breaking the commercial bonds which united them to
England, gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to their maritime
genius.  Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union
has increased almost as rapidly as the number of its
inhabitants.  The Americans themselves now transport to their
own shores nine-tenths of the European produce which they
consume.  And they also bring three-quarters of the exports
of the New World to the European consumer.  The ships
of the United States fill the docks of Havre and of
Liverpool, whilst the number of English and French vessels at
New York is comparatively small.  Thus, not only does the
American merchant brave competition on his own ground,
but even successfully supports that of foreign nations in
their own ports.  This is readily explained by the fact, that
the vessels of the United States cross the seas at a cheaper
rate....
</p>

<p>
"It is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can
navigate at a lower rate than other nations; one is at first
led to attribute this superiority to the physical advantages
which nature gives them; but it is not so.
</p>

<p>
"The American vessels cost almost as much to build as
our own; they are not better built, and they generally last
a shorter time.  The pay of the American sailor is more
considerable than the pay on board European ships, which
is proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be
found in the merchant vessels of the United States.  How
happens it then, that the Americans sail their vessels at a
cheaper rate than we can ours?  I am of opinion that the
true cause of their superiority must not be sought for in
physical advantages, but that it is wholly attributable to
moral and intellectual qualities....
</p>

<p>
"The European sailor navigates with prudence; he sets
sail only when the weather is favorable; if an unforeseen
accident befals him, he puts into port; at night, he furls a
portion of his canvass; and when the whitening billows
intimate the vicinity of land, he checks his course, and
takes an observation of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
"The American neglects these precautions and braves
these dangers.  He weighs anchor before the tempest is
over; by night and by day he spreads his sheets to the
wind; he repairs as he goes along, such damage as his
vessel may have sustained from the storm; and when he at
last approaches the term of his voyage, he darts onward to
the shore as if he already descried a port.
</p>

<p>
"The Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader
crosses the seas so rapidly.  And, as they perform the same
distance in shorter time, they can perform it at a cheaper
rate.....
</p>

<p>
"I cannot better explain my meaning, than by saying
that the Americans show a sort of heroism in their manner
of trading.  The European merchant will always find it
difficult to imitate his American competitor who, in adopting
the system which I have just described, does not follow
calculation, but an impulse of his nature.....
</p>

<p>
"Reason and experience prove that no commercial prosperity
can be durable if it cannot be united, in case of need,
to naval force.  This truth is as well understood in the
United States as anywhere else; the Americans are already
able to make their flag respected; in a few years they will
make it feared.....
</p>

<p>
"Nations, as well as men, almost always betray the
prominent features of their future destiny in their earliest
years.  When I contemplate the ardor with which the
Anglo-Americans prosecute commerce, the advantages which aid
them, and the success of their undertakings, I cannot help
believing that they will one day become the first maritime
power of the globe.  They are born to rule the seas, as the
Romans were to conquer the world."[*]

<p>
To a reader of the present day, these words, albeit they
were written nearly a hundred years ago, seem to have been
almost inspired by superhuman wisdom, so accurately do
they describe the present position of the United States as a
maritime power; but if any American could have read them
about the time of the "Battle of the Swash," they would
have seemed either to convey the severest sarcasm of which
human speech is capable, or else to have been the wild and
unmeaning utterances of drivelling idiocy.  For at this time,
thanks to English privateers, and American stupidity and
indifference, the American flag had practically disappeared
from the ocean.
</p>

<p>
As has been already mentioned, English shipowners and
manufacturers were suffering severely from American
competition; they therefore hailed the possible or probable
dismemberment of the American Union with delight, and
immediately upon the outbreak of the "War of the Rebellion,"
determined to aid the seceding States in every possible
way.  These States were exclusively agricultural communities,
raising most of the cotton which formed such an
important portion of the raw material required by English
factories.  Like all partially developed agricultural
communities, they had no capital to invest in vessels or factories;
and in case they secured their independence, they were
pledged to Free Trade, and would thus offer a vast and
profitable carrying trade to English ships; and a vast and
profitable market for English goods.  The temptation was
a great one; too great in fact to be resisted; and a short
time after the commencement of the war, a number of
so-called "Confederate cruisers," which had been built and
fitted out in English ports with English money, were scouring
the ocean, capturing and destroying American merchant
vessels wherever they could find them, and compelling the
transfer of such as were not destroyed, to the protection of
some neutral flag.  As our ancestors were at that time
engaged in a life and death struggle to maintain their
national existence, they could only protest against this
selfish and unfriendly action of England; but the guilt of
the latter power was practically conceded at an arbitration
conference held at Geneva several years later, at which the
sum of $15,000,000 was awarded as damages to be paid by
England for the depredations committed by these piratical
cruisers upon American commerce.  The mischief, however,
was done; our ocean commerce had been ruined; and
England could well have afforded to pay $15,000,000
<i>annually</i> for having thus paralyzed her great maritime rival.
</p>

<p>
Concurrently with this wiping out of our shipping by
English cruisers, iron and steel began to be used as a
substitute for wood in ship building; and by the time that the
rebellion had been finally crushed, our shipbuilders found
themselves utterly unable to compete with those of Great
Britain on account of the greater cost of materials and
wages here, as well as the absence of machinery and
appliances for building iron and steel vessels.  Gold remained
at a premium for several years after the conclusion of the
war; and this, together with the tariff on imported
materials required in ship building, rendered competition with
foreign builders absolutely impossible.  To make matters
worse, all the principal maritime nations of Europe
inaugurated a system of subsidies or bounties, which stimulated
shipbuilding enormously, and increased the supply of vessels
so rapidly, that carrying rates fell to figures, with
which unsubsidized vessels could not possibly compete.
England, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland, and
finally Spain, went into the subsidy business; and the
latter power actually subsidized lines of steamers to the
extent of over $1,000,000 per annum, to run along our
whole Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, trading between Mexico
and Central America on the south, and Canada and British
Columbia on the north, and stopping at all important
American ports on their respective routes.
</p>

<p>
The only demand for American built vessels was for
the coasting trade; but this demand was sufficient to induce
the establishment of several large iron shipyards, most of
which were located on the Delaware River, at or near
Philadelphia, Chester, and Wilmington.
</p>

<p>
Thus was inaugurated that interest which has since
attained such enormous proportions, as to give to the
Delaware River the <i>sobriquet</i> of "The American Clyde."
</p>

<p>
The vessels built at these yards, even in those early days,
proved conclusively that American shipbuilders were still
the best in the world, and then as now, American coastwise
steamships were conceded to be the finest and fleetest and
best vessels of their class afloat.  The absolute refusal of
Congress to offer any subsidy, or even to offer decent
compensation to American vessels for carrying the mails to
foreign countries, effectually prevented the building of any
ships suitable for that trade; and while England and
France and Germany and Spain were building swift merchant
steamers on plans approved by their naval departments,
and paying them liberal annual subsidies for the
privilege of chartering or purchasing them at a fixed price,
at any time, and converting them into aimed cruisers;
thus providing themselves at a comparatively trifling cost
with a most formidable and efficient auxiliary naval force;
the Congress of the United States, with an apathy or
indifference which seems utterly unaccountable at the present
time, absolutely refused to do anything to encourage the
rebuilding of the American Merchant Marine.
</p>

<p>
That such a suicidal policy should have been persisted
in for more than twenty years after the close of the war,
at a time when the annual receipts of the Treasury were
over $100,000,000 in excess of the government requirements,
and when the extraordinary spectacle was presented
day after day, of senators and members of Congress,
wrangling and arguing over the question of "how to dispose
of the surplus," seems absolutely incredible; and yet,
a perusal of the files of the newspapers published during
this period, (say from 1875 to 1888) will satisfy the most
skeptical reader that it is strictly true.  For the convenience
and satisfaction of such of my readers as may not be
able easily to refer to these files, I reproduce a few articles
and communications from some of the journals of that
period.

  SUBSIDIES TO BRITISH STEAMSHIPS&mdash;ARRANGEMENTS<br />
  WITH THE WHITE STAR AND CUNARD LINES.<br />
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>From the New York Journal of Commerce, March</i> 31, 1887.
</p>

<p>
"A Liverpool cablegram received yesterday says: 'At
the meeting of the stockholders of the Cunard Steamship
Company to-day the chairman announced that the Government
had granted the company an annual subvention of
$85,000 for a period of five years for the 'carrying of the
mails.'
</p>

<p>
"Details of the agreement entered into between the
British Admiralty and the owners of the White Star and
Cunard companies, by which certain of their vessels are
placed at the disposal of the Government on specified
terms, are contained in a late parliamentary paper.  The
White Star Line agrees to hold at the disposition of the
Government for purchase or hire, at the option of the
Admiralty, to be exercised from time to time during the
continuance of the agreement, the following vessels:
Britannic, value £130,000; Germanic, £100,000; Adriatic,
£100,000; Celtic, £100,000.  In the event of purchase the
foregoing prices were to be held as the values of the vessels
on January 1, 1887, plus 10 per cent. for compulsory sale,
less an abatement of 6 per cent. per annum on the
depreciated annual value for the period that might elapse
between January 1, 1887, and the date of purchase by the
Government.  In the event of charter by the Admiralty
the rate of hire of the before-mentioned vessels was fixed
at the rate of 20s. per gross registered ton per month, the
owner providing the crew, or at the rate of 15s. per gross
registered ton per month, the Admiralty finding the crew,
all risks of capture and of hostilities being assumed by the
Admiralty.  The company has determined to build one or
two vessels of high speed and of such a type and speed as
will render them specially suitable for service as armed
cruisers, and in accordance with the plans and specifications
submitted and approved by the Admiralty.  In consideration
of this the Admiralty will have to pay to the
company an annual subvention at the rate of 15s. per
gross registered ton per annum.  On February 8, the
Admiralty accepted similar proposals made by the Cunard
Line in respect to the following vessels: Etruria, value
£310,000; Umbria, £301,000; Aurunia, £240,000; Servia,
£193,000; Gallia, £102,000&mdash;a subvention of 15s. per gross
registered ton per annum, to be paid to the company on
account of the Etruria, Umbria and Aurania during the
continuance of the postal contract, and in the event of the
termination of that contract before these three vessels
received five years' payment, the company to be entitled to
receive for the balance a subvention at the rate of 20s.,
the five vessels being still held at the disposition of the
Government.  In the event of the Cunard Company building
new vessels for the mail service, they will submit the
plans to the Admiralty for approval.
</p>

<p>
"The subvention will amount to about £6,500 for each
of the new vessels of the White Star Line, so long as they
carry the mails, or £8,500 should the mails be withdrawn.
The annual charge for the retention of the Cunarders
Etruria, Umbria and Aurania is stated at £5,400 each.
</p>

<p>
The Admiralty announce that they are ready to make
the same arrangement as with the White Star Company for
the first ten steamers that may be offered by any of the
British steamship companies."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The following letter from Admiral D. D. Porter shows
conclusively the feeling which must have existed in Naval
circles upon the subject of the revival of the American
Merchant Marine.  The letter was addressed to a Mr. Aaron
Vanderbilt, representing the American Shipping and
Industrial League and was published in the New York <i>World</i>
and other journals, some time during the year 1888.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
DEAR SIR: I received your letter and pamphlet this
morning in relation to American shipping.  It is a matter
in which I am greatly interested.  I only wish I really had
some influence in this country to help forward measures for
the advancement of our mercantile marine, without which
we can never be a great naval power.  I have written a
great deal on the subject and the files of the Senate have
now many letters of mine in favor of granting subsidies to
ocean steamships, in order to open lines wherever they
could be run to advantage.  Indeed, I have been so persistent
in this matter ever since the close of the civil war
that I ran the risk of being considered queer&mdash;for that is
the term people apply nowadays to men of progressive ideas,
whose opinions come in conflict with those of persons who
are altogether guided by local prejudices.
</p>

<p>
I have written a good deal for the <i>American Protectionist</i>
on the subject, also a long article for the Chicago <i>Inter
Ocean</i>, covering one side of the paper, which had an extensive
circulation in the West.  I wrote so much that I was afraid
I might come under the head of "penny-a-liner," but all
to no purpose, as the cause didn't seem to advance an inch.
</p>

<p>
This country is a young giant, full of resources,
overflowing with wealth, and the people themselves full of
progressive ideas, yet you see how difficult it is to get
anything done even for the defense of our coast and great
cities.
</p>

<p>
With all our wealth and enterprise we are, owing to the
force of circumstances over which our people seem to have
no control, Bourbons up to the hub, learning nothing and
forgetting nothing.
</p>

<p>
The nation that can put the most ships and the best
ships on the sea will be the one that can set the world at
defiance.  No nation can put its commerce on its bottom
again, after it has been broken up as ours has been,
without subsidies, which are considered by some people as
opposed to our institutions, although I myself cannot see
it: but subsidies to steamships that must carry our products
over the world and bring back other products in return
must help every industry in the country.  Every State in
the Union is interested in having our commerce re-established,
no matter at what cost.  Think what an impetus
the establishment of great lines of steamships would give to
our iron and steel interests.  How many thousands of
mechanics who are now out of employment would again
enjoy ample compensation for their labor.  What rejoicings
there would be throughout the land at such an event.  How
the cotton and hemp manufactories would be crowded with
workers.  Think how many million yards of canvas would
be spread upon the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The great British steam lines which are running to and
from our ports so frequently, bring their coal from England
and take little back from this country.  Think of the coal-mines
that would be worked to supply our great ocean steam
lines should we ever establish such as are necessary to the
country.  Sit down and reckon the different industries that
would be benefited by the establishment of great steamship
lines, and you will be surprised at the amount that would
be thrown into the hands of the laboring people of this
country.
</p>

<p>
What is the object of a government if it is not to build
up the industries of a country, as opposed to those of other
countries?  A republican government should be the best in
the world.  Its legislators should advance all its industries.
It should be more paternal in its organizations than any
other, for those who are elected to office are put there by
the people to promote their interests.  We have gone on for
the past twenty-five years, showing no more ability to cope
with the matters to which I have referred than the minor
republics of South America, which scarcely hold any place
in the estimation of the world.  Instead of being a government
for the people, ours seems to be a government made
for the advantage of a select clique.
</p>

<p>
I almost despair, although not naturally of a despairing
nature.  I thought when our civil war was over and there
was no longer a question which could seriously divide the
country, that we would put our household in order and unite
to become the great nation of the world, which we are fully
capable of doing; but, with thousands of others who helped
to fight for the country and put it on its legs again, I have
been wofully disappointed, particularly in the decadence of
that ocean commerce which was once second only to Great
Britain.
</p>

<p>
Even Spain, that has been for years behind all other
nations, and for more than sixty years has been considered
the most effete government in Europe&mdash;Bourbon all over&mdash;has
now taken the lead of us, has voted millions in a lump
to build up her navy, and is about to establish those very
steam lines which should have been American.  If this
country does not take proper steps to resurrect our
commerce and place a number of steamship lines on a footing
with those of European countries, foreigners may well say
that the resources of the country have been developed faster
than the education of the people has progressed, and that
the Americans are not sufficiently advanced in intelligence
to understand that no nation can be a first-class power
that allows another to do its carrying.  For my part, I
expect to step out soon without witnessing the fulfilment of
any of my cherished ideas.  As for the "naval reserve"
they are talking about at present, it ought to have been
established in the days of the Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Every steamship that we build for ocean service should
be able to carry guns, and the Government should condemn
her for national use whenever it is considered necessary&mdash;in
fact, exercise greater power over the mercantile marine than
over the militia.  An organization of this kind, however,
can only be established by stringent acts of Congress, without
which no action of the Secretary of the Navy or a board
of officers would enable the Government to use merchant
vessels.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, however, in this direction can be done the
present session, and we can only hope that a more enlightened
feeling in regard to these matters will be shown in the
future than has prevailed in the past.
</p>

<p>
The people who make this outcry against "subsidies"
apparently do not reflect that no nation in the world has
gone so far in this direction as the United States.  For
instance, the grants to the great railroads which connect the
Atlantic with the Pacific, by which millions of dollars and
millions upon millions of the public lands were given,
enough to have built up our mercantile marine and navy
twenty times over; yet few people have objected to these
donations on the part of the Government, as it was felt to
be the only means by which we could open the country for
settlement and obtain control of the great commerce of the
East.
</p>

<p>
That was the great cry at the time, but unfortunately
we only half did the work we started to accomplish, and
failed to continue the road to China by not appropriating
money to put upon the Pacific a sufficient number of
steamships to entirely control the China trade, and give us a large
number of fast and powerful vessels that could, when necessary,
be transformed into heavily armed men-of-war for the
protection of our northwest coast.
</p>

<p>
At the present time a single powerful vessel of an enemy
could devastate the whole of that coast.  I remain, very truly
yours, DAVID D. POUTER, Admiral.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a letter to the <i>New York Tribune</i>, published in May,
1887, Mr. H. K. Thurber, Pres't of the N. Y. &amp; Brazil
S. S. Co., among other strong language, used the following:
</p>

<p>
"'Trade is following the flag' with a vengeance.  The
policy that mails on the ocean should not be paid a much
higher rate than 'inanimate freight' is bringing its fruits
home to us in a very unpleasant manner.  The direct
contrary policy of England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy
is driving the stars and stripes from the Ocean.  Will
Americans sit tamely by and see this insane policy
continued?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The following letter addressed to this same Mr. Thurber,
and, (curiously enough) signed by a person bearing
the same name as the author of this book, (probably a
member of the same family) was also published in several
newspapers about this time.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 1887.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>H. K. Thurber, Esq., President U. S. &amp; B. S. S. Co.:</i>
</p>

<p>
DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of your pamphlet, and I
beg to say that in my humble judgment it is entirely
unanswerable, and that the mere statement of facts which
it contains should bring the blush of shame to every
American cheek.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, if we were not living witnesses and victims of
it, it would be utterly beyond belief that such a stupid and
vicious system as that under which our mercantile marine
is being absolutely strangled "in the house of its friends"
could prevail in any country having the slightest pretensions
to intelligence or enterprise; and it is certainly not
too much to say that if our present laws had been framed
by our worst national enemies or our bitterest commercial
rivals, they could not be more effectual in paralyzing our
foreign commerce and rendering us as nearly as possible a
cipher among the nations of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Two years ago I was obliged to give up active business
on account of ill health, and since that time I have
traveled quite extensively in Europe, and the most striking
fact which confronted me at every turn, was the enormous
increase and development of foreign trade among nations
which we have hitherto regarded as only second or third
rate commercial powers.  This remarkable development, in
which France and Germany took the lead, has extended to
other countries, and Italy, Spain and even little Belgium,
are rapidly coming to the front as great maritime nations.
Upon inquiring into the causes of this remarkable increase
of commercial activity, I found that it was entirely due to
the policy of "protection by bounty" or subsidy.  Moreover,
it has been made principally at the expense of the
United States of America.
</p>

<p>
England has of course suffered to some extent also: but
I think it is entirely within bounds to assume that at least
75 per cent. of the foreign traffic secured by these
enterprising Europeans within the last fifteen or twenty years,
is traffic which rightfully belongs to us, and which we
should have had, if our law-makers had exhibited the
slightest desire to foster our commercial interests.
Walking along the magnificent wharves of Antwerp, I saw
steamer after steamer loading and unloading for and from
ports in South America, whose trade by every natural law
should come to us.  It was the same at Southampton and
Liverpool and Havre, and even away down in Naples there
were evidences on every hand of how we Americans are
being robbed of what may be justly considered our
birthright; that is, South American, West Indian, and even
Mexican trade.  The intense and monumental stupidity
which permits this process to continue, is doubtless amusing
to those who profit by it, but it is death to us as a maritime
nation.
</p>

<p>
It seems inconceivable that with an overflowing Treasury,
and with exports of over $700,000,000 per annum, our
shipping interest should be thus wiped out of existence
merely because a lot of idiots have inherited a political
superstition which invariably throws them into spasms of
indignant protest whenever the word "subsidy" is mentioned.
This inherited superstition is practically all there
is behind the opposition to a fair and reasonable system of
protection and encouragement to our shipping interest.
</p>

<p>
Of what use are arguments in the face of patent and
notorious facts?  Our commerce was swept from the ocean
during our civil war.  Its place has been usurped by
subsidized vessels of other countries.  Against these vessels
unsubsidized ones cannot compete successfully.  This is
the whole question in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
Shall we, by a judicious system of paying a fair price
for American mail service, restore our foreign commerce,
and take once more the front rank among maritime
nations?  Or shall we continue to yield to the paralyzing
influence of a mere word, which only represents an idiotic
and threadbare superstition; and turn our whole enormous
export trade over to our foreign competitors, who, while
ridiculing our stupidity, gladly take advantage of it, and
pocket the profits which we thus thrust upon them?
Public sentiment is gradually changing on this great
subject; and the demand for reasonable and sensible
legislation in the interest of American shipowners will soon make
itself heard with no uncertain sound.  Meanwhile, the fact
that practical and intelligent business men are taking part
in the public discussion of it, is one of the most encouraging
signs of the times.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  I remain, yours very truly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAM BARTON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is scarcely necessary for me to say that the foregoing
letter expresses what my sentiments would have been at
that time, quite as fully and as well, as I could, if I had
written it myself.
</p>

<p>
Not only had our merchant marine thus been permitted
to be wiped out of existence, but our navy had also become
worn out and decayed, and our antiquated coast fortifications
were the laughing stock of military and naval experts
all over the world.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the deplorable condition of the United
States Navy, Secretary Whitney, in his annual report for
1885, said, "At the present moment it must be conceded
that we have nothing which deserves to be called a navy.
It is questionable whether we have a single naval vessel
finished and afloat at the present time, that could be trusted
to encounter the ships of any important power&mdash;a single
vessel that has either the armor for protection, speed for
escape, or weapons for defense."
</p>

<p>
This was a notorious fact, as was also the defenseless
condition of our seaboard cities.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Samuel J. Tilden&mdash;who was the democratic candidate
for President of the United States in 1876, and who
was believed by many to have been elected, notwithstanding
the decision of the electoral commission in favor of
Mr. Hayes&mdash;had in a public letter, made a very strong appeal
for the utilization of the so-called surplus revenues in
fortifying our coasts.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Porter in his report for the year 1887, also
made the following astounding statement in this connection:
</p>

<p>
"Two heavy iron-clads could commence at the eastern-most
point, and proceed along the coast to Texas, laying
every city under contribution.  In time of war, the torpedo
system will be useless for defense in the absence of proper
fortifications and guns.  For the event of war we are no
more prepared than we were a year ago; although we have
made a beginning to repair simply the waste in our navy
for the past twenty-five years."
</p>

<p>
A writer in the <i>North American Review</i> of July, 1888,
had also called attention to the utterly defenseless condition
of our seaports, and showed that a hostile fleet anchored in
New York Harbor, could destroy property valued at
$1,500,000,000 in New York, $600,000,000 in Brooklyn,
and $100,000,000 in Jersey City.  The only alternative to
such a bombardment would be the payment of a ransom,
whose amount would of course bear some relation to the
immense amount of property involved.
</p>

<p>
The <i>New York Herald</i> had also, during the summer of
1887, published a series of sensational articles, showing the
enormous amounts of property thus exposed on our Atlantic,
Pacific and Gulf coasts.  It will thus be seen that our
ancestors had not even the excuse of <i>ignorance</i>, in permitting
such a state of affairs to continue.  The question had
been the subject of frequent conferences and investigations;
and committees and sub-committees had reported
upon it, times without number.  The fortification board
had estimated the cost of a complete system of coast defences,
including armored turrets and casemates, barbette and
mortar batteries, rifled guns, torpedoes, torpedo boats and
floating batteries, at $126,377,800; and bills had been
introduced looking to the gradual expenditure of that amount
of money, such expenditure to cover a period of ten years.
But all such propositions were met by the "economical"
statesmen of that day, with howls of indignant protest;
and were characterized as attempts to steal and squander
the proceeds of an excessive and burdensome system of taxation,
which was levied for the sole benefit of a privileged
class of manufacturers, monopolists and capitalists.  Thus
these backwoods statesmen, nine-tenths of whom would
probably have failed, if they had attempted to carry on any
business more extensive than the keeping of a peanut
stand, assumed to be the judges of what was the best
economy for a nation of over 60,000,000 of people, and
exemplified their ideas of economy by rolling up an annual
pension list of about $150,000,000; spending $30,000,000 or
$40,000,000 in so-called river and harbor improvements
and public buildings in different parts of the country; and
absolutely <i>throwing away</i> $20,000,000 or $30,000,000 in
paying exorbitant premiums for the privilege of cancelling
a debt not yet due.  And thus it had come to pass, that in
the year of grace, 1886, the United States of America,
with a population of more than 60,000,000, with a coast line
whose length was more than double that of any other
country, with an annual available revenue of more than
$100,000,000, notwithstanding that its system of taxation
was lighter and less burdensome than that of any other
nation, and its laboring classes better paid, better housed,
better clothed, better fed, and better educated than any
similar classes in any other portion of the world; and with
an annual foreign commerce exceeding $1,600,000,000 in
value, found itself practically without any merchant
marine, and actually without a single war vessel with the
"necessary armor for protection, speed for escape, or
weapons for defense;" with its coasts and harbors entirely
unprotected, and its seaports,&mdash;containing property aggregating
more than $10,000,000,000 in value&mdash;utterly defenseless,
and absolutely inviting attack from any nation which
possessed a modern iron-clad, armed with two or more long
range guns, capable of throwing a shell ten miles or so.
This will doubtless seem an incredible statement to readers
of the present day; and yet it is strictly true.  Moreover,
these rural solons, in their zeal for what they considered
"economy," unsettled the industrial interests of the
country by an acrimonious discussion of the tariff; and the
most lightly taxed, prosperous, intelligent and wealthy
community in the world was asked to believe that it was
ground down and oppressed by an excessive and burdensome
system of taxation; and "the surplus," "<i>the surplus</i>,"
"THE SURPLUS," was held over it constantly <i>in
terrorem</i>, as a monster that was eating out the nation's
vitals, and would soon involve it in financial ruin.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, new fortifications were recommended year
after year, and the necessity for these was conceded by both
political parties; but&mdash;they were not built.
</p>

<p>
Elaborate estimates for the establishment of gun foundries
were made and favorably reported on; but&mdash;the foundries
were not built.  Huge appropriations for formidable
armored battle ships were talked over and recommended;
but&mdash;the armored battle ships were not built.
</p>

<p>
Bills looking to the re-establishment of our mercantile
marine by the adoption of a similar system of encouragement
to that in vogue among all modern maritime nations,
were introduced, and debated on, and argued over; but&mdash;the
bills were not passed, and our merchants were obliged
to continue shipping their goods in foreign bottoms.
And all this criminal failure to adopt ordinary defensive
precautions, was justified on the ground of "<i>economy</i>."
If history ever exhibited a striking instance of the folly of
"saving at the spigot and wasting at the bung," our
ancestors of the latter part of the nineteenth century may
fairly claim pre-eminence as exhibitors in that line.  But I
must not anticipate.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
SECRETARY WHITNEY'S EFFORTS TO REBUILD THE NAVY.
</h3>

<p>
Upon his accession to the Presidency in March, 1885,
President Cleveland had appointed a Mr. William
C. Whitney, a New York lawyer, secretary of the Navy; and
although he had had no previous experience in naval
matters, he seems to have been profoundly impressed with
the necessity of rebuilding the Navy, and bringing it up
to a standard more in consonance with modern methods,
and more in keeping with the vast national interests which
it might at any time be suddenly called upon to protect
and defend.  During his entire term of office, Secretary
Whitney's reports and official communications were invariably
couched in the most earnest and vigorous language;
and bore the strongest possible testimony to the serious
importance with which he regarded his position; and it is
not too much to say that many of the features which at
present cause the United States Navy to rank first among
the navies of the world, grew out of suggestions and
recommendations made by Secretary Whitney.
</p>

<p>
Like all reformers, however, his path was beset with
many difficulties; and although he persisted bravely in the
task he had set for himself, he encountered so many
obstacles and discouragements, that his health became
seriously impaired, and it was only at the earnest
solicitation of the President, and leading members of his party,
that he consented to serve his full term of four years.
During President Cleveland's administration party feeling
ran very high, and the Republicans, who had recently been
ousted from power, after a continuous enjoyment of it for
twenty-four years, seemed to look upon any effort to alter
or increase or improve the Navy, as a reflection upon their
previous management of the department.  Consequently,
Secretary Whitney found himself opposed and hampered at
every turn; and his well-meant and intelligent efforts in
the direction of reform, encountered the open or concealed
opposition of Republican Senators and Congressmen; and
as the Republicans still held control of the Senate by a
narrow majority, but few of his recommendations were at
first favorably acted upon.  Thus does party prejudice at
times outweigh patriotism; and thus the best interests of
the country are often neglected or jeopardized in obedience
to the behests of a political boss, or in deference to the
supposed necessities of a partisan organization.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult at this late day, to conceive of such a state
of affairs as this; but as a partial vindication of our
ancestors against a charge of what might almost be called high
treason, we must remember that the passions and prejudices
which grew out of the "War of the Rebellion," still found
a resting-place in the bosoms of most of the older inhabitants;
and these extended to the political discussions of
the day, rendering party feeling exceedingly bitter and
vindictive.
</p>

<p>
In fact, what would at present be regarded as an absurd
impossibility, was then an actual fact; and the two great
political parties of the country, twenty years after the close
of the Civil War, found themselves divided on precisely the
same sectional lines, which had existed previous to and
during that conflict; and the most casual reference to the
journals of that date can scarcely fail to reveal one or more
allusions to "The Solid South," as a political entity whose
interests must have necessarily been antagonistic to the
other portions of the Union.
</p>

<p>
The vast manufacturing and mineral interests of Alabama,
Georgia and Tennessee, were then in their infancy;
and the people of those States still hugged the delusion of
free trade, as a sort of an inherited political superstition, in
common with the other Southern States, whose interests were
almost wholly Agricultural, and which have since found their
proper and logical political affiliation with the Agricultural
States of the West and Northwest.
</p>

<p>
During President Cleveland's term of office, the Senate,
as has before been remarked, was Republican by a small
majority.  The House of Representatives, however, was
Democratic; so that there was a practical deadlock on all
party questions; and as nearly every question that arose
became more or less of a party one, scarcely anything in
the way of practical legislation was accomplished.  In fact
it would seem that about the only measures which could
safely run the gauntlet of both houses, were bills of the
nature of jobs to rob the treasury, which were passed by
what were called (in the political slang of that day)
"logrolling" methods.
</p>

<p>
For instance, if a river or harbor needed improvement,
the member of Congress in whose district it was situated,
looked around for other members who had one or more
rivers or harbors similarly affected; and a number of these,
combining together, would originate what was called a
"river and harbor bill," in which each member's district
was to have a good slice of the total appropriation.  Then,
if there were not votes enough to secure the passage of the
bill, other members were drummed up, and were offered
appropriations for creeks and harbors in their districts&mdash;the
expenditure of which would of course be under the direction
of their political friends&mdash;and thus, at every session of
Congress, a gigantic appropriation bill, amounting frequently to
$20,000,000 or $25,000,000 was passed; two thirds of which
in all probability was sheer robbery.  A similar system was
pursued with reference to public buildings in different parts
of the country; and the extraordinary spectacle was
presented, of Senators and Representatives meeting in
Washington, year after year, wrangling over these appropriations,
and exhibiting their ignorance of the cardinal principles of
political economy, in long-winded harangues about "the
treasury surplus," while they permitted the United States
Navy to go to decay, refused appropriations to fortify the
harbors and coasts, and utterly failed to do anything to
foster and encourage the re-establishment of the American
Merchant Marine, whose value as a nursery or training
school for the development of a naval force, had been so
conclusively shown in the earlier days of the Republic.
</p>

<p>
At the time of Secretary Whitney's accession to office,
the whole available naval force of the United States
consisted of a few old wooden vessels, so rotten as to be scarcely
seaworthy, three or four iron-hulled steam corvettes and
frigates, of an antiquated and obsolete type, and a few
vessels of the "Monitor," or revolving turret style (so
called from the fact that the first vessel of this type was
called the "Monitor").
</p>

<p>
These latter, however, were in an unfinished, rotten and
rusty condition, having from motives of "economy" been
permitted to lie and rot at their docks ever since the
conclusion of the Civil War; and were therefore utterly useless
for any sudden emergency; as several month's work would
have been required to finish the unfinished ones, and repair
the completed ones.  It is true, that a commencement to
rebuild the navy had been attempted during President
Arthur's administration, and two modern cruisers, (the
Boston and Chicago) and a despatch boat (the Dolphin)
were approaching completion when Mr. Whitney became
Secretary of the Navy.  These vessels, however, were only
partially successful; and when finished, were found to fall
far below the requirements of the contracts; and it was
only after a long series of tests, and many expensive
alterations, that they could be rendered serviceable.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all obstacles, however, Secretary Whitney
did make considerable progress in rebuilding the Navy.
During the years 1887 and 1888, several new cruisers were
added to its effective force, and the construction of two
heavily armored battle ships was commenced.  Numerous
experiments were also made with torpedoes, and various
submarine systems were tried with greater or less prospects
of success.
</p>

<p>
A lieutenant in the army named Zalinski, had invented
a pneumatic gun, which he claimed would safely throw a
dynamite shell a distance of two miles; and a vessel was
built expressly to carry guns of this kind.  Discussion more
or less heated, concerning the disgracefully unprotected
condition of our seaboard cities, had been carried on in the
newspapers, and at length, early in 1889, the city of New
York (or rather a few of its more public-spirited citizens)
organized a system of volunteer harbor defense militia.
</p>

<p>
The Legislature having been appealed to in vain,
private subscriptions were started, and a fund was raised
sufficient to charter one or two harbor tug boats, and to equip
a marine battalion, mostly of longshoremen and stevedores,
who were drilled in torpedo practice, electric light
signaling, boarding, cable cutting, anchor tripping, night
attacks, and various other plans for annoying or disabling
supposed hostile ships in our harbor.  This drilling and
exercise were supervised and carried on under the direction
of intelligent naval officers, detailed for that purpose by the
Navy Department, and although the limited means at the
disposal of the originators of this plan, prevented them
from accomplishing any very important results, yet their
efforts were instrumental in getting together a splendid
body of men, who could be relied upon at any time, in case
of a sudden emergency, to volunteer their services; and
whose practical skill as a signal corps, and perfect
knowledge of the harbor, would render their co-operation of the
utmost value to the regular naval force in time of war.
</p>

<p>
This was in fact the origin of our present magnificent
and complete "Harbor Defense Corps," which has so often
challenged the admiration of foreign naval experts.  Anybody
who should at this time publicly advocate its abolition
or its curtailment, on mere grounds of "economy," would be
ridiculed as an idiot, or branded as a traitor; and yet the
Legislature of New York refused even to grant its members
exemption from jury duty, on account of the protest of a
few intelligent and incorruptible(?) back country members.
</p>

<p>
Having thus given a general resumé of the condition and
situation of the United States up to the years 1887 and
1888, I will in the next chapter endeavor to give a succinct
and intelligible review of the events which had a more
direct and immediate effect in causing the "Battle of the
Swash."

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.
</h3>

<p>
It would be foreign to the purpose of this work, besides
being a useless reviving of animosities and prejudices, now
happily forgotten, were I to discuss the <i>merits</i> of the
controversy between Canada and the United States; which
from trifling and unimportant beginnings, gradually
increased in bitterness and intensity, until it finally embroiled
the two countries, and England as well, in war.  The
contest was long ago waged to its legitimate and final
arbitrament; and its results have been acquiesced in by all
the interested parties, and are a part of the history of the
nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless a brief sketch of the origin and progress
of this controversy, seems essential to this narrative, as
showing the motives which actuated Canada and England
in their final action.
</p>

<p>
This sketch I will endeavor to make as brief as is
consistent with a clear presentation of the subject-matter.
</p>

<p>
Long previous to the Revolutionary War, in which the
American Colonies secured their independence from British
domination, and founded the United States of America,
the vast value of the fisheries on the George's and Grand
Banks, and along the North American and Newfoundland
coasts, had been fully demonstrated; and even as early as
the sixteenth century, nearly all of the maritime nations of
Europe sent fleets to catch the fish which were known to
abound there.
</p>

<p>
The French and English, however, at length succeeded
in obtaining exclusive possession of the privilege; although
as late as 1783, Spain put forward a claim of the right to
participate in it.
</p>

<p>
This claim was, however, not pressed.  Previous to the
successful revolt of the American Colonists in 1770,
several wars had occurred between England and France,
the final result of which had been to expel the French from
Canada, and to secure to England a practical monopoly of
these valuable fisheries.  The fishing industry had by this
time vastly increased in value and importance, and was
very largely engaged in by the people of the New England
Colonies.
</p>

<p>
Indeed the importance of the industry was such, that
the long point of Massachusetts was christened Cape Cod;
gilded codfish were largely used as weather vanes on church
spires, and on the public buildings; a painted codfish hung
in the State House in Boston, as a constant reminder to the
law-makers of the importance of the fishing interest; and
the fortunate and enterprising fishermen, who accumulated
wealth sufficient to enable them to pass the autumn of their
lives amid quiet and luxurious surroundings, came to be
known as the "Codfish Aristocracy."
</p>

<p>
In the year 1783 a treaty of peace was finally concluded
between the United States and Great Britain, which defined
the rights of the citizens of the United States to these
privileges, as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
ARTICLE III.
</p>

<p>
It is agreed that the people of the United States shall
continue to enjoy unmolested the right to take fish of every
kind on the Grand Bank, and on all the other banks of
Newfoundland; also in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and all
other places in the sea where the inhabitants of both
countries used at any time heretofore to fish; and also that the
inhabitants of the United States shall have liberty to take
fish of every kind on such part of the coast of Newfoundland
as British fishermen shall use (but not to dry or cure
the same on that island), and also on the coasts, bays, and
creeks of all other of His British Majesty's dominions in
America, and that American fishermen shall have liberty
to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled bays, harbors
and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen Islands and Labrador,
so long as the same shall remain unsettled; but so soon as
the same or either of them shall be settled it shall not be
lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such
settlement without a previous agreement for that purpose
with the inhabitants, proprietors or possessors of the
ground.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This article clearly defined the rights of the American
fishermen, and if it could have remained in force, and its
provisions been honorably carried into effect, no further
trouble would probably ever have arisen over the subject of
the fisheries.
</p>

<p>
In 1812, however, the United States engaged in a second
war with Great Britain, and in the treaty of peace which
was negotiated at Ghent, in the year 1814, no mention
whatever was made of the right of the American people to take
fish in Canadian waters.  The reason for this omission,
seems to have been that the American representatives,
among whom were Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams,
maintained that the rights guaranteed by article three of
the treaty of 1783, were not created by that treaty, but
were merely recognized by it, as permanent rights already
existing, and of such a character that they were not to be
affected or superseded by any rupture of friendly relations,
or even by war.
</p>

<p>
The same treaty, (1783) had conceded to the British
the right to free navigation of the Mississippi River, but
since that treaty had been signed, the United States had
purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, and had
thus metamorphosed that great river into an exclusively
American waterway.  The American commissioners therefore,
being unauthorized to concede navigation rights on
the Mississippi, in consequence of this change of ownership,
the British commissioners claimed some concession as an
offset to this refusal; and a compromise was agreed upon,
by which no mention was made either of the British claim
to navigate this river, or of the American claim to fish in
Canadian waters.
</p>

<p>
The situation, however, was not satisfactory, and after a
long diplomatic correspondence between the two governments,
a new treaty was negotiated in London in the year
1818, which among other things, contained the following
provision:
</p>

<p>
"That the inhabitants of the United States shall have
forever in common with the subjects of His Britannic Majesty,
the liberty of taking fish of any kind, on that part of the
southern coast of Newfoundland which extends from Cape
Race to the Ramean Islands; on the western and northwestern
coasts of Newfoundland, from the said Cape Race to the
Quispen Islands; on the shores of the Magdalen Islands;
and also on the coasts, bays, harbors, and creeks, from
Mount Joly to the southern coast of Labrador, to and
through the Straits of Belle Isle, and thence northwardly,
indefinitely along the coast.  And that the American fishermen
shall have liberty forever, to dry and cure fish in any
of the unsettled bays, harbors and creeks, in the southern
part of Newfoundland hereinbefore described, and of the
coasts of Labrador; but as soon as the same or any portion
thereof, shall be settled, it shall not be lawful for said
fishermen to dry or cure fish at such portion so settled, without
previous agreement for such purpose, with the inhabitants,
proprietors or possessors of the ground.
</p>

<p>
"And the United States hereby renounces forever, any
liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants
thereof, to take, dry, or cure fish, on or within three
marine miles of any of the coast, bays, creeks, or harbors of
His Britannic Majesty's dominions in America not included
in the above mentioned limits.  Provided, however, that
the American fishermen shall be permitted to enter such
bays or harbors for the purpose of shelter, of repairing
damages therein, of purchasing wood and obtaining water,
and for no other purpose whatever.  But they shall be
under such restrictions as shall be necessary to prevent their
taking, drying, or curing fish therein, or in any other manner
whatever, abusing the privileges hereby secured to them."
</p>

<p>
This treaty, which may fairly be said to have been the
cause of all the trouble which afterwards arose on the fishery
question, was negotiated on the part of the United States,
by Mr. Rush, then American Minister at the Court of
St. James, and Mr. Gallatin, his associate commissioner; but
as it was subsequently ratified by the Senate of the United
States, it would be scarcely fair to hold those two gentlemen
wholly responsible for the disgraceful and humiliating
surrender of rights and privileges which had hitherto been
freely conceded to American fishermen.
</p>

<p>
The treaty, by its very terms, invited disturbances and
misunderstandings, which were not slow in manifesting
themselves.
</p>

<p>
In the very next year, (1819) the English Parliament
passed an Act, which provided that American vessels found
within the three-mile limit might be seized and condemned;
and imposed fines on such as refused to depart from such
bays or limits, after being warned.  The Canadian Parliaments,
taking the cue from this legislation of the mother
country, passed numerous and stringent laws and regulations,
which they claimed were necessary to carry out the provisions
of the treaty; but which the Americans claimed were
needlessly annoying, oppressive, and unneighborly.
</p>

<p>
Among other claims, what was known as the "Headland
theory" was advanced, under which the three-mile limit
was claimed not to follow the sinuosities of the coast, but to
be a line three miles outside of a straight line drawn from
point to point, or headland to headland of the coast; no
matter how far apart these points or headlands might be, or
how extensive the bay or gulf might be which lay between
them.  Under this construction of the treaty, Nova Scotia
claimed the right to close the Straits of Canso to our
fishermen; and to make her claim to exclusive jurisdiction over
that body of water more plausible, annexed Prince Edward's
Island.
</p>

<p>
Numerous seizures of American vessels were made and a
strained condition of affairs ensued, which lasted a number
of years, and which temporarily culminated in 1843, in the
seizure of an American fishing vessel, called the "Washington,"
in the Bay of Fundy, at a point more than ten miles
from the nearest shore.  This induced a protest from the
United States, in response to which the English Government
agreed to waive the Headland theory as far as it related to
the Bay of Fundy, but not as to any other bay or gulf.
</p>

<p>
The contention continued, and in 1851 the English
Government announced its intention of sending a fleet to
the fishing grounds for the purpose of enforcing its rights.
</p>

<p>
More diplomatic correspondence ensued, and at length,
in 1853, a board of arbitration was empowered to decide this
phase of the controversy; and decided that bays ten miles
or more in width, were to be considered as part of the open
sea.  This was followed in 1854, by what has been called
the reciprocity treaty; which, in consideration of the abolition
of the three-mile restriction, and of the restoration of
the rights to take fish, and to cure and dry the same on the
Canadian Coasts, which had been conceded without any
equivalent in the treaty of 1783, the United States agreed
to admit nearly all Canadian products free of duty.
</p>

<p>
This treaty by its terms was to remain in force for ten
years, and to continue in force thereafter until after twelve
months' notice of the desire of either party to terminate it.
</p>

<p>
During the continuance of this treaty, the War of the
Rebellion occurred; our national debt assumed enormous
proportions; our tariff and internal taxes were vastly
increased to meet the expenses of the war and the interest
on the debt; and what in 1854 bad seemed a mere bagatelle&mdash;viz.,
the duty on Canadian imports&mdash;assumed an importance,
as an item of revenue, entirely disproportionate to the
value of any additional fishing privileges which the treaty
gave us.  Consequently, in 1865, the United States gave the
requisite twelve months' notice, and in 1866 the treaty came
to an end.  Canada, having for twelve years experienced the
advantages of an unrestricted market in the United States
(the direct pecuniary value of which in duties remitted, alone
amounted to 14,200,000, or $350,000 a year) was naturally
reluctant to give them up, so she returned to her former
methods, construed the former treaty in a narrow and illiberal
spirit, and let no opportunity slip to annoy and outrage
our fishermen.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the United States Government was engaged
in a controversy with the English Government over the
claim for damages to American shipping, committed by the
so-called Confederate cruiser "Alabama" during the "War
of the Rebellion," and a joint commission representing the
two countries assembled in Washington in 1871 to negotiate
a treaty, which should, if possible, arrange all matters in
dispute&mdash;including, of course, the fisheries question.
</p>

<p>
Their deliberations resulted in the treaty of Washington,
by which our fishermen, in addition to the rights conferred
by the treaty in 1818, received permission to fish in
the bays, harbors and creeks of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, and Prince Edward's Island, and the islands
adjacent thereto; and by which, also, fish oil and fish of all
kinds (except fish of inland lakes and fish preserved in oil)
were to be admitted into each country free of duty.  A
question arose as to whether the admission of Canadian fish
free of duty was a sufficient equivalent for the increased
fishing privileges granted to the American fishermen.  The
British Commissioners insisted that it was not; and the
American Commissioners insisted that it was; but finally
offered to pay Great Britain one million dollars as full
consideration for the right to use forever the inshore fisheries
in common with the English and Canadian fishermen.  The
parties could not agree, and the question was referred to a
commission of three, consisting of one American, one
Canadian, and the Belgian Minister to the United States.
Six years later, in 1877, this commission&mdash;or rather the
Belgian minister (for the Canadian and American
Commissioners disagreed)&mdash;decided that the United States
should pay Great Britain $5,500,000 for this privilege;
which, added to the $4,200,000 of duties remitted under
the reciprocity treaty of 1854, made the snug sum of
$9,700,000 paid by the United States for a privilege which
was conceded by the treaty of 1783 to be a vested and
permanent right.
</p>

<p>
This was bad enough in all conscience, but to make it
if possible worse, and more galling to Americans, the
charge was openly made by Professor Hind, who had been
the British scientific witness before the commission, and
had acted as the official compiler of the index to the documents
used in the investigation, that the statistics in these
documents had been manufactured and forged for the
purpose of misleading the commission, and defrauding the
United States.
</p>

<p>
The Professor, after trying in vain to induce the
Canadian and British governments to remedy this flagrant
injustice, laid the matter before Senators and Representatives
in Washington.
</p>

<p>
Some little attention was attracted to these disclosures
at the time, but presumably from a fear that a public
discussion of them would reflect upon the party in power at
the time of the negotiation of the treaty, no official action
was taken, and the matter was permitted to drop out of
sight.
</p>

<p>
The treaty of Washington also provided, that either
Canada or the United States might export or import goods,
wares and merchandise through the other's territory free of
duty, and also permitted such goods, wares and merchandise
as might be carried through Canada by rail from any point
in the United States to another point in the United States,
to pass through the Dominion of Canada and re-enter the
United States free of duty.  It also abandoned the right,
which the United States had always claimed&mdash;and which
England had always dreaded&mdash;to send out privateers in case
of war.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, taken as a whole, the treaty of Washington
may be fairly ranked as one of the greatest triumphs of
British diplomacy.  Having by their own privateers (for the
"Alabama" and her consorts, although ostensibly "Confederate
Cruisers," were in reality nothing more nor less
than British privateers, built and equipped for the express
purpose of preying on American commerce) effectually
driven our flag from the ocean, they hoodwinked our
diplomatists into a relinquishment of the right to fit out
similar cruisers, as a sort of a "sop," to make the payment
by Great Britain of the $13,000,000 damage award, a little
more palatable.  Verily, it would seem that for the first
century of its national existence, the diplomacy as well as
the financial policy of the United States was a creature of
chance and circumstance.  In diplomatic matters, our
representatives seemed to be guided by no permanent
policy; and to be able to see nothing beyond the immediate
question at issue; and our whole financial policy was utterly
devoid of anything like consistency or system.
</p>

<p>
The treaty of Washington was to remain in force for
ten years; and was then subject to abrogation, as to certain
of its parts, on two years' notice by either party.
</p>

<p>
Its gross unfairness to the United States was so apparent,
that on the 3rd of March, 1883, (almost as soon as
the treaty permitted) Congress directed the President to
give the requisite notice to terminate certain articles of it,
and thus, in 1885, the subject was again a matter of dispute
between the two countries.  The avowed policy of Canadian
statesmen seems to have been to force the United States
into a reciprocity treaty, which would practically secure
commercial union between that country and Canada, and
with that idea in view, Canada immediately commenced to
annoy and harass American fishermen, claiming that the
setting aside of the Washington Treaty revived that of 1818,
and under the provisions of the latter, the right of our
fishermen to enter Canadian harbors or bays, or to come
within the three-mile limit for any other purpose than
shelter, repairing damages, or to purchase wood and water,
was absolutely denied; and several American fishing vessels
were seized and condemned by the Canadian authorities,
who were evidently determined to enforce their own harsh
construction of the treaty of 1818, in the most offensive
and unneighborly manner.  Meanwhile, during the pendency
of the treaty of Washington, Canada had been
investing largely in railroad enterprises, and had subsidized
one trans-continental line (the Canadian Pacific) to the
extent of about $130,000,000.  These railways, taking
advantage of the clause in the treaty of Washington which
permitted the transit of goods in bond through Canadian
Territory into American, and vice versa, without the
payment of duty, had obtained control by building, purchasing
or leasing, of numerous connecting lines, which gave them
outlets and inlets to all of the principal American cities;
and had thus become open competitors with the American
trans-continental lines for American business.  The
following extracts from an address made by General James
H. Wilson before the Committee on Commerce of the House
of Representatives on March 15, 1888, will show to what
an extent this traffic had grown; and also that a feeling of
impatience had begun to develop among Americans at the
unneighborly and piggish attitude of Canada, in refusing
ordinary hospitality to American fishermen, while robbing
the American railways of millions of dollars worth of
business each year.
</p>

<p>
"The simple fact is that while the arrangements under
consideration are reciprocal in theory they are one-sided in
practice, and inure tenfold more to the advantage of the
Canadian people than to that of the American railroads or
the American people.  Nevertheless, as I have stated
before, the amendments which I have had the honor to
offer to the Inter-State Commerce Act do not cover, nor are
they intended to interfere in any way with the particular
transit trade carried on under the provisions of Article
XXIX of the treaty of 1871.  I make this statement clear
and distinct, for the special information of the Chicago
Board of Trade, and of those who have shared its
apprehensions.
</p>

<p>
"Second.  Under the provisions of paragraphs 3000 to
3006 inclusive, of the Revised Statutes, together with
certain regulations thereunder, issued by the Secretary of the
Treasury, a transit trade of great extent and value is
carried on between the Eastern, Western, and Pacific States
and Territories through the agency of the Canadian
railroads, and certain American railroads owned and controlled
by them.  And it is to this variety of the transit trade to
which I invite your most careful attention.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to have grown up <i>pari passu</i> with the
Dominion system of railroads.  It is now carried on principally
by three Canadian railroads and railroad systems:
</p>

<p>
"1. The Canada Southern Railroad, opened for business
in 1873.  It was built, it is understood, entirely under
American auspices, if not with American capital, and is
now controlled by the Michigan Central Railroad Company
in the interest of the New York Central system.  Its main
line runs from Windsor, Ontario, to Suspension Bridge,
and, with its branches, is 302.44 miles long.
</p>

<p>
"2. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, with a main
line extending from Portland, Me., to Detroit, Mich., a
distance of 861 miles; another from Niagara Falls to Windsor,
Ontario, 229 miles, branches and extensions sufficient
to give it a total length of 2,924.5 miles.  The road was
opened from Portland to Montreal, mostly through American
Territory it will be observed, in 1853; from Montreal
to Quebec in 1854, from Montreal to Toronto in 1856; and
from Montreal to Port Sarnia and Port Huron, on the
St. Clair River, in 1858.  It acquired by purchase and
construction a line now known as the Chicago and Grand
Trunk, extending from Port Huron to Chicago in 1879,
and the whole line was opened for through business in
1880.  A part of this system, known as the Great Western
Railway, was completed in 1854, but was not
consolidated with the Grand Trunk till 1882.
</p>

<p>
"This system first began to do a transit business in
imported merchandise, in a small way, from Toronto to
Collingwood on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, in 1854; but
it never became a great competitor of the American Trunk
lines till 1880, nor became a great disturber of rates till
1882.
</p>

<p>
"It was built for political and military as well as for
commercial purposes, has received frequent subsidies from
the Canadian Governments, and has always had more or
less of their fostering care.  Ever since its through lines
were opened, it has enjoyed the privilege of unrestricted
competition with the American roads between the West
and all points in the Atlantic States that it could reach.
It has enjoyed all the privileges of an American railroad;
it has been active, aggressive, and unscrupulous, and has
inflicted great injury upon its competitors.
</p>

<p>
"3. The Canadian Pacific Railway extends from Montreal
to Port Moody and Vancouver, on the Pacific Ocean,
a distance of 2,905.3 miles.  At Montreal it connects with
the Intercolonial Railway, running from that place to
Halifax, Nova Scotia, 678 miles.  The latter road and its
branches are owned and operated by the Government of
Canada.  The total distance from Halifax to Vancouver is
therefore 3,583 miles; and the total length of main line
and branches of the two systems is 5,522 miles.  Their
aggregate cost and capitalization are $206,942,852, besides
a subsidy of 25,000,000 acres of public lands, all of which,
both money and land, has come directly or indirectly
from the Dominion of Canada, which guarantees the interest
on the funded debt, and also dividends upon the capital
stock till August, 1893.  Notwithstanding the princely
subsidies which this corporation has received, the length of
line which it has constructed, the monopoly which it has
secured, and the high political mission it has filled in
binding together the widely separated provinces of the
Dominion, its managers are not yet satisfied.  Spurning all
restraint, it has finally overleaped the boundary line and
boldly invaded the territory of the United States.  With
true English effrontery it ignores the authority of Congress,
and under the thin disguise of a charter procured by
trickery and deception, if not by fraud, from the Legislature
of Maine, it is now building a cut off through the
northern part of that State to St. Andrews, New Brunswick,
with all the rapidity that the unlimited control of
men and money can command.
</p>

<p>
"Just what the volume and value of the transit traffic is,
it is impossible for me to state, but the statistics are
doubtless in the possession of the Bureau of Statistics, or can be
more readily obtained by it than by any private individual,
and I venture to suggest that, whatever other action may
be taken by your committee in respect to this important
matter, it should not fail to call for the statistics in
question.  Some idea may be had of its enormous volume from
the statement made by the Chicago Board of Trade that
the Grand Trunk alone 'received from its rail connections
at the Detroit River, and at its lake ports on Lake Huron
and Georgian Bay, during the year 1888, 1,629,283 tons of
United States products,' which it transported eastbound
through the Dominion of Canada in bond and reëntered
the United States free of duty.  This, as near as I can
make out, was something like 15 per cent. of the entire
volume of east-bound business from that region.  The
entire business by the various Canadian routes east and
west bound cannot be less than 5,000,000 tons dead weight,
and has been estimated by an expert at 7,000,000.
</p>

<p>
"It is well known that the Grand Trunk Railway, by
means of its Chicago and Michigan connections and branch
lines, and by those which connect it with Portland, Me.,
under the privilege allowed it by the laws and Treasury
regulations heretofore cited, is the great beneficiary of the
transit trade.  It has been shown that the Canadian
Pacific, under the same laws and regulations, has been free
almost from the day it was opened, by means of the bonded
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, and by its connections
with the roads running north and east from St. Paul to the
Canadian border, and by its connections at Niagara Falls,
Kingston, St. Albans, and Montreal, to carry any business
it can secure between San Francisco on the west, to New
York and Boston on the east.
</p>

<p>
"It should be remembered that these roads constitute
more than one-half of the entire railroad mileage of the
British possessions in North America, that one of them was
built for military and political purposes by the Government
of the Dominion and under the special encouragement and
sanction of the British Government, for the purpose of
carrying out its scheme for federating its North American
colonies; that both of them have been heavily subsidized
by the Dominion Government for purposes antagonistic, if
not absolutely hostile, to our national interests, and that
they are not only absolutely free from any control by us, or
from the Dominion Government to make whatever local
or through rates they please, but, as matter of fact, are
frequently engaged in cutting the rates of the American trunk
lines, paying rebates, granting passes, charging more for a
short haul than for a long one, and entering into all kinds
of private arrangements with their American connections
and their American shippers, to the prejudice and injury
of the American Trunk lines, whose hands are bound in
respect to all those and many other matters by the
Inter-State Commerce Act.
</p>

<p>
"It is also the fact that, while the Canadian railways are
enjoying these extraordinary privileges, unheard of in any
other country, the Dominion Government has protected its
Pacific line by a practical monopoly of all the business on
or tributary to it, and positively refuses to allow American
railways to take wheat out of Manitoba, haul it through the
United States, and redeliver it in Canada free of duty; and
this is a fact which cannot be successfully denied.  Not
only is it true, but it is also true that the Dominion
Government has refused, and still refuses, to permit the people
of Manitoba to build an independent railway to connect
with the American system of railroads, and this refusal is
made for the avowed purpose of continuing and protecting
the monopoly which the Canadian Pacific Railway has of
the business of that region.  The unjust and oppressive
conduct of the Dominion Government, controlled as it is
by the Canadian Pacific Ring, is matter of public notoriety,
and has been the subject of earnest and repeated
remonstrances at Ottawa on the part of the people of Manitoba
within the last thirty days, but so far without effect.
</p>

<p>
"But this is not all.  While they or their connections at
Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, New York, St. Albans, Boston,
Portland, and San Francisco are compelled by the
Inter-State Commerce Act to make their through rates to all
American points public, the roads lying wholly in Canada,
forming parts of their through lines, existing wholly under
Canadian law, and managed by officers and directors
entirely beyond our jurisdiction, are under no restrictions
whatever as to rebates, drawbacks, passes, constructive
mileage, car mileage allowances, or any other of the
numberless devices by which one line gains advantage over
another, or by which a long through line gives advantage
to a short connection.
</p>

<p>
"The trouble with Canada and the Canadian Railroads
is that we have become accustomed to treat them as though
they were not foreign and did not belong to a foreign
empire.  They expect to have all the benefits of unrestricted
trade without any of the limitations and burdens which
are imposed so freely upon our own railroads and citizens.
</p>

<p>
"They and their attorneys claim that in carrying freights
between American points 'the Canadian Railroads have
conformed to the letter and spirit of the Inter-State Act as
rigidly as have their American competitors.'  But inasmuch
as that act requires no duty whatever from the roads wholly
in Canada, and no duty from their American connections,
except to publish their through rates, the absurdity of this
claim is at once apparent.  No one in his right mind can
successfully contend for a moment that the Great Trunk
or the Canadian Pacific pays any more attention to the
Inter-State Commerce Act in Canada, than if it were so
much waste paper.  They are perfectly free to violate every
one of its provisions, from the first paragraph to the last,
and, as a matter of fact, its only effect, so far as they are
concerned, is to make it all the easier for them to cheat
and deceive, if not to actually pick the pockets of their
American rivals, who are bound by the law and subject to
the surveillance of the Commissioners and the punishment
of the courts.
</p>

<p>
"It the Canadian railways were not subsidized and
supported by the Dominion Government, if they were not an
essential part of the machinery used for binding the British
empire together, and in case of need to transport armies
and military munitions against our frontier; if they were
not free from our local and general laws, and also free to
do all the things which have been pointed out, and, in
short, were not daily doing them to our detriment and
injury, we should have no cause of complaint against them.
But so long as the facts remain as they are, so long as those
railroads run through a foreign country and are controlled
by aliens, under foreign laws, and for purposes which, to
say the least, are foreign to us and hostile to our permanent
national interests, it can be regarded as no more than
prudent if we shut them out of our transit traffic along our
northern border, just as we shut foreign ships out of our
coasting trade.
</p>

<p>
"The great republic, in the words of Prince Bismarck,
'fears nothing but God.'  It has no apprehension for its
safety, and but little for its peace from its neighbors of the
Dominion; but it should not forget that the Dominion has
an area of 3,500,000 square miles and a population of about
5,000,000 souls, and is backed up by the whole British
empire, upon whose possessions it is the Englishman's
boast that 'the sun never sets,' that 'her drum beat
encircles the world,' that 'her ships fill every sea,' and
that her population is not less than 300,000,000 souls.  It
should not forget that it has had difficulties before with
that universal bully, and will probably have them again; it
should not forget that it has, out of its abundance and
good-nature, nurtured and fostered the British bantling on
our borders, enriched its railroads, patronized its canals,
granted it the right of free transit through our territories,
enriched its shopkeepers, and generally treated it with
amiable liberality and indifference.  Now that the subject
has become of enough importance to be considered, Congress
should not forget to act in accordance with its own
ideas of interest and duty, even if Canada should
'retaliate.'  We have had reciprocity enough, such as it has
been; now let us try what virtue there is in insisting upon
our right to manage our own affairs in our own way, while
leaving the Dominion and the other dependencies of the
British crown (if there are any others) in North America
to manage their own in a similar way.  We have played
second fiddle long enough.  Let the British Government
spend just as much money as it pleases for fortifications;
let it subsidize and support as many railroads as it thinks
necessary to tie the British empire together; let it open
and improve one or more of its (Canadian) seaports, and
let it retaliate just as and when it pleases.  But let it do
all these things without our help or connivance; and then,
if in God's Providence the Canadian Dominions do not
come otherwise under the sway and the uses of the Union,
when a great emergency arises which seems to demand it,
we shall go and take them."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
RETALIATION.
</h3>

<p>
During the period from 1885 to 1888 the ill feeling
growing out of Canada's treatment of the fisheries question
increased; and began to assume proportions which indicated
a possible outbreak of hostilities between the two
countries.
</p>

<p>
A temporary arrangement was entered into between the
then American Secretary of State, Mr. Bayard, of Delaware,
and the British Minister; and President Cleveland
recommended the appointment of a commission to negotiate a
new treaty.  Congress, however, refused to authorize such
a commission, but in March, 1887, passed a joint resolution
authorizing the President in case vessels of the United
States were, or then lately had been denied or abridged in
the rights secured to them by treaty or law; or any rights
secured by Canada to the most favored nations, whether
vessels licensed for trading or other vessels, or have been
unjustly vexed, to close our ports to vessels of the British
Dominion of North America, "and also to deny entry into
any port or place of the United States of fresh fish or salt
fish, or any other product of said Dominion, or other goods
coming from said Dominion to the United States."
</p>

<p>
President Cleveland, however, did not avail himself of
the powers granted by this resolution; but being apparently
desirous of securing a permanent settlement of the question
by a new treaty, he appointed three commissioners to meet
an equal number appointed on behalf of Great Britain,
notwithstanding the fact that Congress had expressly
disapproved of such a settlement.  The commissioners, thus
appointed, recommended a treaty, which was in August,
1888, rejected by the United States Senate, by a strict party
vote&mdash;the Republicans still having control of that body.
</p>

<p>
Probably, the Republican Senators were largely influenced
in their action, by the fact that a Presidential election
was then pending; and Mr. Cleveland being a candidate
for re-election, they were unwilling that his administration
should have the prestige which might accompany
the successful settlement of this great controversy.
</p>

<p>
Whatever their motives may have been, the ultimate
results of their narrow-minded partisanship&mdash;as will be
seen in the sequel&mdash;were most disastrous to the country.
For the first time in its history, the Senate had discussed
this treaty in open session.  Diplomatic discussions of this
kind had previously always taken place in executive
session, with closed doors.  But a movement had been
made to supercede what some demagogues of that day
called the "Star Chamber" system of executive sessions,
and this treaty happening to come up for discussion at the
time when this agitation was at its height, the Senate, by a
close vote, decided that the discussion of it should be held
with open doors.  Much partisan feeling was exhibited on
both sides during the debates.  The Republicans took very
strong ground against the treaty; claiming that it surrendered
valuable rights which had always been conceded to
the United States; and gravely charged the President and
Secretary Bayard with being desirous of fostering British
interests, at the expense of their own countrymen.  The
Republican press throughout the country took up this cry;
the President was roundly denounced as an English
sympathizer; and the rejection of the treaty by the Senate was
hailed by these party organs as a well-deserved rebuke to a
President and a Secretary of State who were willing to
make such disgraceful concessions to England.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the rejection of the treaty, President
Cleveland astonished the country, and especially the Republican
Senators, by a special message, in which he requested
greater powers to inflict retaliatory measures upon Canada,
than had been given him by the joint resolution of Congress
passed in 1887.
</p>

<p>
This message, as a matter of course, created a profound
sensation in Canada and Great Britain, as well as throughout
the United States.
</p>

<p>
The President was charged by his political opponents
with inconsistency; in that he had not attempted to use
the retaliatory powers already given him, and proved their
insufficiency, before asking for additional ones; but after
considerable wrangling and debate, Congress passed an act,
giving him the power he asked for.  A strict enforcement
of this would give almost a deathblow to the Canadian
Railway lines; as a very large proportion of their traffic
was American business, without which most of them could
scarcely expect to pay running expenses.  The finances of
the Dominion were also in a very bad way, owing to the
large subsidies paid these railways, and to indebtedness
contracted for canals, and other public improvements; so that
practical non-intercourse with the United States meant
practical bankruptcy for Canada.  And now, the most
curious phase of the whole controversy developed itself.
The Canadians were divided into two parties; one favorable
to continued English rule; and the other desirous of
commercial, and if necessary, political union with the
United States.  Strange to say, both these parties
conceived it to be to their interest to increase the tension
between the two Governments, even to the point of war;
but for reasons which were diametrically opposed to each
other.  The British sympathizers supposed that a war
between England and the United States in the then
unquestionably defenseless condition of the latter power,
could not fail to result favorably to England, and that the
latter's hold upon Canada would thereby become stronger
and more direct than before.  The other party desired war,
because they felt confident that no matter how successful
England might be at the outset, in bombarding and
destroying the seaport cities of the United States, yet she
could never establish a foothold on shore, and that the
United States would inevitably take possession of Canada,
and thus bring about the union of American and Canadian
interests which they so much desired.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of these two sets of opinions among the
Canadian politicians, the Canadian Government adopted a
plan of conduct towards Americans which soon became
utterly unbearable.  American fishing boats were seized
and condemned on the most flimsy pretexts.  American
tourists were stopped at the Canadian frontier, and
subjected to the most humiliating and rude treatment, under
the pretense of custom-house examination.  The mails to
and from the United States were delayed and tampered
with by Canadian officials, and every possible means of
annoyance and insult which Canadian ingenuity could
conceive of, was put in operation against the persons and
property of such Americans as happened to come under
Canadian jurisdiction.  Concurrently with this, the
newspapers on both sides were full of denunciatory and
inflammatory articles, and the old Irish fenian party in the
United States came to the front once more, as a disturbing
element.
</p>

<p>
A small body of these men established a so-called
"camp of observation," at a point on the Canada boundary
line near Rouse's Point; and with the usual flourish and
bluster which characterize the race, announced their
intention to march on Montreal, as soon as their ranks should
be recruited to a certain number.  The Governor of the
state of New York called out a regiment of militia to hold
these fellows in check temporarily, until a detachment of
United States troops, which had been ordered to the scene
of trouble by the President, could reach there.  Meanwhile
the Canadian authorities had ordered troops to the scene
of action, who encamped on the Canadian side of the
boundary line, in plain sight of the American militia and the
Irish fenians.  The Canadian newspapers went into spasms
of indignant protest at what they called this "barefaced
threat to invade Canada," and altogether affairs had gotten
into such a condition that the merest spark was certain to
produce an explosion.  This was in the autumn of 1889.
In November of that year, the long expected spark made its
appearance, and produced the long dreaded explosion.
Several of the fenians had left their camp one afternoon,
and had visited a drinking saloon on Canadian territory,
just over the boundary line.
</p>

<p>
Meeting some Canadian soldiers there, both parties got
drunk, and a quarrel ensued, during which pistol shots were
freely exchanged, and numerous bayonet and sabre cuts
were given and received.  The Irishmen being outnumbered,
were gradually driven towards the boundary line,
whore they were met by a large party of their friends, who
hearing the noise of the fighting, had rushed to the
assistance of their companions.  Thus reënforced, they beat the
Canadians back to their own side of the line, but not being
satisfied with this, pursued them for some distance on
Canadian territory.  Here meeting further Canadian troops,
the tide of battle was reversed again, and the Irishmen
were driven back to their camp.  The American militia
regiment was under arms and in line, on the American
side of the boundary, having been called to arms at the
commencement of the disturbance; and as they marched
towards the boundary, with the idea of capturing the Irish
men and holding them for punishment, they were fired
upon by the Canadian troops, either by mistake or
designedly, and several were killed and wounded.
</p>

<p>
They returned the volley (it is claimed, without orders)
and several Canadians were also killed and wounded.
</p>

<p>
At length, in obedience to the arduous efforts of the
officers on both sides, the fighting ceased; but not until
there had been six killed and thirty-three wounded among
the Irish and Americans, and four killed and twenty-one
wounded among the Canadians.
</p>

<p>
From testimony taken in a subsequent investigation, it
seems that both commanders claimed to be on their own
territory; and the burden of evidence would seem to
confirm their claims that there had been no actual technical
violation of territory on either side; but that the two
parties had simply stood each on their own ground, and
shot at each other across the boundary line.
</p>

<p>
This outbreak, however, afforded the Canadian politicians
the opportunity they had long been waiting for, and a
resolution passed both branches of the Dominion parliament,
by an almost unanimous vote, declaring war against
the United States, subject to the approval of the Imperial
Government.
</p>

<p>
It being just the commencement of the winter season,
and therefore a most unfavorable time to undertake
hostilities, both sides sought to gain time, and a voluminous
diplomatic correspondence ensued; during which both the
United States and England were exerting every effort to
prepare for the struggle which was considered to be
inevitable as soon as spring opened.  Work was pushed night
and day on the unfinished war vessels; and a large force of
men were placed at work upon the sea-coast forts to try
and strengthen them as much as possible.  Additional
guns were brought from the interior and mounted in the
forts as rapidly as practicable; and the hurry and bustle of
preparation was noticeable from one end of the country to
the other.  As yet, war had not been definitely declared,
except by Canada, and the President had issued no call
for troops; but everybody knew that the call could not
be long delayed; and the "Grand Army Men," as the
veterans of the War of the Rebellion styled themselves,
organized themselves into battalions and regiments, and
met and drilled two or three times a week, and were ready
to respond instantly to the call of the President, as soon as
it should be issued.  An enrollment of these volunteer
associations, taken on January 1, 1890, showed a total of
over 300,000 veterans ready and anxious to go to the front
once more.
</p>

<p>
Besides these, there were enthusiastic young men by the
million, who had been children during the War of the
Rebellion, but who were fired with a patriotic desire to
resent the outrages and insults which they thought their
country had received at the hands of Canada.
</p>

<p>
As far as the land forces were concerned, nothing more
could be desired.  The Government, it was evident, would
be embarrassed by a superabundance of force, rather than
a lack of it; and the indications were that within thirty
days after war was declared, a thoroughly well drilled,
well equipped, well armed, and well officered army of at
least half a million of men, would be ready to overrun
Canada in the shortest possible space of time.  The more
enthusiastic ones, claimed that the campaign would be over
in thirty days after the boundary line was crossed.  Others
said that the war might last sixty days, and here and there
one or two might be found who thought that possibly it
might take all summer.  There was no difference of
opinion as to the result.  The only differences were as to
the time it would require to bring it about.  The idea that
this over-whelming and magnificent force could receive
anything approaching a defeat, or even a check, in its
victorious career through Canada, never entered anybody's
head.  But there were numerous bets made on the
exchanges and elsewhere, as to the number of days the
campaign would last.  The whole country seemed to be in
a blaze of military enthusiasm, and it became all the rage
for young men to chaff each other about "spending next
summer in Canada."  On the surface, therefore, everything
appeared satisfactory, and the only apparent drawback was
a feeling that Canada couldn't offer resistance enough to
make the struggle even an interesting one.  Under this
apparent confidence, however, there was a vast amount of
anxious foreboding in the minds of a few of the more
thoughtful residents of our seaboard cities.
</p>

<p>
These men knew the utterly defenseless condition of our
coasts.  They knew how absurdly inadequate our Navy was
to cope with that of England.  They had seen the fast
passenger steamships of the Cunard and other English lines,
(two of which, belonging to the Inman line, the "City of
New York," and the "City of Paris," were owned by
Americans) withdrawn from the passenger service, and
transformed into armed cruisers in accordance with the
terms of the contracts by which the English Government
paid them an annual subsidy or rental, amounting to about
four per cent. of their cost.  The cable had brought news
of the feverish activity which reigned in all the English
dockyards and arsenals.
</p>

<p>
Of course, details of these preparations were not forthcoming;
but the utmost reticence of the officials could not
conceal the fact that war preparations on an immense scale
were being pushed forward with the utmost rapidity.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Americans were not idle.  Congress had
been called in special session by the President, in view of
the gravity of the situation, and immense appropriations,
aggregating between $200,000,000 and $300,000,000 were
rushed through both houses in frantic haste; and a tremendous
effort was made at a vast expense, to lock the stable
door, which had so long been invitingly left open.  There
was no time to build large vessels or heavy guns; so the
greatest efforts were made to perfect a system of harbor
obstructions and torpedoes.  All sorts of experiments were
tried in this direction; and the whole inventive genius of
the country seemed to be puzzling itself over the problem
of self-defense.
</p>

<p>
Of course it goes without saying that the newspapers in
all three countries reaped a rich harvest.  No rumor was
too absurd or sensational to find believers, and the public
mind was wrought up to an intensity of feeling on both
sides, that was almost inconceivable in its bitterness and
rancor.
</p>

<p>
In March, 1890, the excitement was, if possible, intensified
by a remarkable speech delivered in the British House
of Commons by Lord Randolph Churchill.  This nobleman
had been a prominent figure in English politics for
several years, and had held numerous Government
positions&mdash;among them Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
leader of the House of Commons.  He was a man of
unquestioned ability, but had come to be regarded by the
older and more conservative public men, as too eccentric
and too unmanageable for a leader.
</p>

<p>
He had, therefore, been reduced to the ranks&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;in Parliament, and had been chafing for two or
three years in what seemed to him to be a position utterly
unworthy of his talents and experience as a parliamentarian
and debater.  The present occasion afforded him an opportunity,
which he was not slow to embrace, of putting himself
once more in a prominent position before the English
public.
</p>

<p>
His speech was entirely unexpected, and created the
utmost excitement on both sides of the ocean.  It was during
a debate on a bill authorizing some of the extraordinary
expenditures for arming and preparing war ships, etc.,
which the Admiralty were then making.  The debate had
gone on sleepily and stupidly, as such debates usually do,
until one evening in March, Lord Churchill threw what
proved to be a veritable bombshell into the discussion.  In
this remarkable speech, his Lordship traced the whole
history of the differences between the United States and
Canada, from 1783 to 1889.  His point of view, of course, was
an intensely English one, and he justified Canada entirely
in the course she had thus far seen fit to pursue.
</p>

<p>
And then, as his listeners were expecting him to
announce himself as heartily in favor of the pending bill,
he suddenly changed the whole aspect of the debate by
asking: "But what has Canada ever done for England,
that we should make these enormous expenditures of money,
and risk a war with such a powerful nation as the United
States, merely for her benefit?  Has she ever contributed
a penny to the Imperial treasury?  Never!  Has she even
paid the expenses of troops and vessels sent out by the
Imperial Government to protect her interests?  Never!
Has she admitted the products of the Mother Country
to her ports free of duty; or, failing in that, has she ever
made any discrimination, however small, in favor of our
products, as against those of the United States, or any
other country?  Never!  She taxes our products, and
while claiming our protection whenever she gets into
difficulty, utterly refuses to contribute anything to our
treasury.  I fail, Sir, to see anything like reciprocity here.
To use a homely American comparison, 'It is like the
handle of a jug&mdash;all on one side.'  If Imperial protection
is worth having, it is worth paying for; and if Canada or
any other outlying portion of this great British Empire, is
not willing to contribute its share of taxation to the Imperial
treasury, I am distinctly and decidedly in favor of having
Imperial protection withdrawn."
</p>

<p>
At this point of his lordship's address, the interruptions
were so numerous and persistent, that he was obliged
to suspend his remarks for a few moments.  After a
semblance of order had been restored, the Premier arose and
begged the privilege of asking his Lordship one question.
</p>

<p>
"Do I understand his Lordship to say that he is in
favor of our permitting the United States to overrun and
annex Canada, without lifting a hand or firing a gun in her
behalf?"
</p>

<p>
As soon as the applause which greeted this question had
subsided, Lord Churchill said he "thanked his Lordship
for having put the question to him in that categorical
manner, because it enabled him to be equally specific and
explicit in his reply."
</p>

<p>
He then went on, and in a most impassioned manner
attacked the United States as a great, overgrown, bullying
and conceited nation.  He traced our wonderful growth
and material prosperity, and characterized it as a standing
menace to every monarchical Government in the world.
Then suddenly changing his tone, he called attention to
our absolutely helpless condition to resist the attacks of a
well equipped fleet of modern vessels of war; and waving
in the air over his head a copy of the <i>New York Herald</i>
of some date in 1887, he exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Here are the figures which prove that property
amounting in value to $10,000,000,000 or £2,000,000,000
sterling is absolutely defenseless, and open to attack by
any power which possesses one or more modern vessels of
war."
</p>

<p>
And then he continued as follows:
</p>

<p>
"His Lordship asks me what I would do.  I will tell
him.  I would equip one, two or three powerful fleets, and
send them to bombard the principal seaboard cities of the
United States.  I would give these arrogant and conceited
Americans their choice between bombardment and ransom,
and I would take good care that the ransom should be a
good liberal one.  I should be inclined to put the figure at,
say £400,000,000 to £500,000,000 sterling.  The Americans
are wealthy, and could well afford to pay it."
</p>

<p>
"But," interrupted the Premier, "what would become
of Canada?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Let the United States have Canada; and much
good may she do them!  I cannot see where she has ever
done us much.  What I would propose in brief, is a
"forced sale" of Canada to the United States; but it will
be a novelty in forced sales, in that the sale will be forced
by the seller upon the buyer."
</p>

<p>
The effect of this speech was marvelous.  What was
then known as the "Jingo" element in England, cheered
it to the echo; and a popular demand sprung up for war,
which was so universal and overwhelming that the Government
found it impossible to resist it, and consequently war
was formally declared in April, 1890.  The words "Ransom
or bombardment" were in everybody's mouth, and
Lord Randolph Churchill became the idol of the populace.
His wife, who was an American lady, lost much of her
former popularity, and with her sister-in-law, the Duchess
of Marlborough (also an American) made a prolonged visit
to the Continent, to avoid the unpleasant attentions of the
riotous London mobs.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE ENGLISH FLEET.
</h3>

<p>
The preparations which had been going on all winter in
English Naval circles were nearly completed at the time of
England's formal declaration of war, so that there was but
little delay before the first fleet was ready to sail.
</p>

<p>
This was intended to operate against New York and
Philadelphia; and was to be followed in about a month by
two others, one of which was to operate against Boston and
other New England seaports; and the other to attack
Baltimore, and thence work southward, bombarding the
cities of Washington, Norfolk, Charleston and Savannah.
</p>

<p>
The first fleet consisted of the turret ships:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Victoria, 11,470 tons, two 110 ton guns.<br />
  Sanspareil, 11,470 tons, one 70 ton gun, twelve 6 inch.<br />
  Edinburgh, 9,150 tons, four 45 ton guns, five 6 inch.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The armored ships:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Camperdown, 10,000 tons, four 67 ton guns, six 6 inch.<br />
  Collingwood, 9,150 tons, four 44 ton guns, six 6 inch.<br />
  Howe, 9,700 tons, four 67 ton guns, four 6 inch.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The partially armed cruisers:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Orlando, 5,000 tons, two 9 inch guns, ten 6 inch.<br />
  Narcissus, 5,000 tons, two 9 inch guns, ten 6 inch.<br />
  Undaunted, 5,000 tons, two 9 inch guns, ten 6 inch.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and the improvised merchant cruisers:
</p>

<p>
  Etruria, Umbria and City of New York.<br />
</p>

<p>
Besides these large vessels, were numerous second and
third class cruisers, despatch boats, and torpedo boats and
launches; so that the total number of vessels, large and
small, in the fleet, considerably exceeded one hundred&mdash;and
all of the larger ones were armed with the most formidable
weapons known to modern science; many of which
had a range of more than ten miles.
</p>

<p>
  he date of the sailing of this formidable fleet (the 20th<br />
of April) was, of course, cabled over the French Cable to
New York&mdash;the English Cables, having been seized by the
Canadian Government, being no longer available to the
Americans.
</p>

<p>
The destination of the fleet could only be surmised, as
it sailed under sealed orders; but it was taken for granted
that it was New York, and preparations were made accordingly.
Immediately after England's declaration of war,
the President issued a call for 250,000 volunteers, which
had been responded to by more than a million men.  The
New York City Militia volunteered in a body to do garrison
duty in the forts of the harbor, and such of the old guns
as didn't burst at the first few experimental discharges at
the targets, were burnished up, and made to look as formidable
as possible.  The marine militia drilled constantly
by night and by day; and the bay and harbor seemed
fairly alive with small craft of all kinds, rushing hither
and thither, each one bent upon some offensive or defensive
experiment.  Stationary and movable torpedoes were placed
in the upper Bay and Narrows, and the whole available
naval force of the nation, amounting, great and small, to
about thirty vessels, were concentrated in the harbor.
</p>

<p>
Several submarine torpedo boats&mdash;of which great things
were expected&mdash;were giving exhibitions of their prowess
constantly, diving under the bottoms of the excursion
steamboats as they went up and down the bay, and inflicting
a vast amount of needless terror upon the timid
excursionists.  Each and every one of these little vessels had
demonstrated the fact conclusively that she could dive
under the largest man of war afloat, and affixing a torpedo
to her bottom, could withdraw to a safe distance, and then
by an electric battery, blow the great war ship into a million
smithereens.  Whenever any of them appeared on the surface
of the bay, therefore, they were regarded with great
awe by the spectators, and were greeted with such remarks
as "I wonder what the Englishmen will think of that little
thing."  "Who would think that such an insignificant
looking little boat could do so much damage?"  "She
has got dynamite enough on board to blow up all New
York," &amp;c., &amp;c., and a feeling of absolute confidence in the
defensive preparations, which had been so hastily made,
pervaded all classes of citizens.
</p>

<p>
Interspersed with these expressions of satisfaction, would
frequently be heard sarcastic regrets that the Englishmen
were running headlong to inevitable death and annihilation,
and the comic illustrated journals acquired great <i>éclat</i>
from their numerous cartoons, in which John Bull was
invariably represented as being <i>in extremis</i>.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the volunteers who had responded to the
President's call, were being rapidly mobilized and
equipped; and camps were established at Plattsburgh and
Buffalo and Detroit; as well as at a point on the Pacific
coast near Victoria in British Columbia.  Thus the Dominion
was threatened with invasion at points nearly three
thousand miles apart; and the prospect was that before the
summer was over, the military operations on both sides
would assume proportions as gigantic as those which had
astonished the world during the War of the Rebellion.
</p>

<p>
Many of the volunteers were veterans of that war; and
therefore the work of drilling them and making competent
soldiers of them, went forward with incredible rapidity;
and within less than sixty days from the issuing of the
President's proclamation, the United States had a thoroughly
well armed, well drilled, and well equipped force
of over 200,000 men in the field, ready to march across the
frontier.  On the fifteenth of April the first entry was
made on Canadian Territory.  Ten thousand men in
two detachments crossed the Detroit River, and took
possession of Windsor, opposite Detroit.  A slight opposition
to the landing of this force was attempted by a small
detachment of Canadian Militia, who after firing a scattering
volley at the ferry-boats containing the Americans,
beat a hasty retreat when the latter began to return the
fire.
</p>

<p>
Two days later, a force of about 25,000 men crossed the
Niagara River near Buffalo, and at once marched inland,
with a view of taking possession of the Welland Canal,
and damaging it in such a manner as to prevent the passage
of some British gunboats, which had been reported as
on their way from Halifax to the Upper Lakes.  This was
a most wise and timely movement; for if these vessels had
gotten through the canal, the cities of Buffalo, Erie,
Cleveland, Toledo, Sandusky, Detroit and Chicago, would have
been completely at their mercy; as under an old treaty
between the United States and England, neither power
could have more than one war vessel at any time on the
Lakes.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, the news of the success of this detachment
in destroying the locks of the Welland Canal, so as to
effectually prevent these vessels from reaching Lake Erie,
was hailed with great delight by the entire press of the
United States, and a grand chorus of jubilation was echoed
from one end of the country to the other.  The main body
of the American troops, however, had been concentrated
near Plattsburgh, in New York State, and were intended to
operate against Montreal and Ottawa.  This consisted of
75,000 men, under the immediate command of General
Schofield, and this army crossed the Canadian frontier at
the point where the Irish fenians had established their
camp the preceding season, on the first day of May, 1890.
No opposition to speak of was encountered, and the army
advanced at once, by easy marches, towards the St. Lawrence
River, with a view to the rapture of Montreal.
</p>

<p>
The movements of the detachment on the Pacific Coast
had not been so prompt us those of the others.  Numerous
delays occurred in the arrival of equipments and supplies,
and therefore that division of the force found itself utterly
unable to move at the time specified&mdash;which had been fixed
for not later than the 1st of May.  This was the general
situation on the 1st of May, 1890.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE BRITISH FLEET ARRIVES OFF SANDY HOOK.
</h3>

<p>
On the morning of the 10th of May, the telegraph
operator stationed at Fire Island, telegraphed to New York
that four large war vessels were in sight, proceeding slowly
westward towards Sandy Hook.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day, numbers of other vessels were
reported as also passing in the same direction; and it
became evident that the long expected fleet had at length
reached our shores.  The excitement which this news
caused in the cities of New York and Brooklyn was intense
and indescribable.
</p>

<p>
Although it had been the uppermost thought in people's
minds for months past, and in spite of the fact that there
had been scarcely any other subject of conversation among
the citizens, and notwithstanding the almost universal
feeling of confidence which had possessed them in the
efficiency of their defensive preparations, the news of the
actual arrival of a hostile fleet&mdash;representing the most
formidable naval power in the world, and presumably
containing all the best and most approved offensive weapons
known to modern science&mdash;seemed to exert an almost paralyzing
effect upon the inhabitants of the two cities.  The
noisy and boisterous ebullitions, which usually accompany
occasions of great public excitement, were entirely wanting.
Business of all kinds was suspended, and in all of
the down-town centers, groups of anxious and pale-faced
men were to be encountered at every corner and street
crossing, engaged in earnest, but quiet conversation.  The
lively spirit of braggadocio and bravado, which had
heretofore been such a prominent feature of every gathering,
large or small, when the pending "invasion" happened to
be the subject of conversation, was noticeable by its total
absence.  Conversation was carried on almost entirely in
hurried and anxious whispers; and anybody who raised his
voice above a colloquial tone&mdash;whether it was an excited
newsboy, shouting out the latest extra; or a half intoxicated
tramp, yelling patriotic defiance to the hated British&mdash;was
looked upon, much as the deliberate violator of some sacred
spot would be regarded, by an enthusiastic believer in its
sanctified character.
</p>

<p>
A complete hush seemed to have fallen upon the two
cities; and a subdued air, as if some impending calamity
had proclaimed its near approach, seized upon the people.
For the first time, a faint idea of the real gravity of the
situation seemed to dawn upon the public mind.  Here
was war, bitter, relentless, destructive, cruel war, at their
very doors.  In a day or two at the latest, possibly within
a few hours, the thunder of distant cannon would be
faintly heard, and the bursting and crashing of deadly
shells would involve the city in ruin and desolation.  What
was to be done?  How could this frightful downpour of
dynamite shells be averted?  What if those formidable
marine monsters were able to defy the attacks of our
insignificant looking little torpedo boats and rams.  Supposing
some of them should be destroyed; what if two, or three,
or even one, should remain uninjured, and should proceed
to pour its hail of deadly projectiles upon these defenseless
and exposed cities?  Who could tell where the shells might
strike, or who would be safe from their deadly work?
Many of the more timid of the inhabitants took time by
the forelock and sought safety in flight.  The newspapers,
however, did much to avert what threatened to become a
panic, by treating the whole subject in a light and cheerful
vein, and their optimistic predictions were regarded as
gospel truths by the great majority of the citizens.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE BATTLE OF THE SWASH.
</h3>

<p>
On the morning of the 11th of May, 1890, the British
fleet crossed the bar, and steamed leisurely past Sandy
Hook, and into the Swash and main ship channels.  The
movements of the fleet seemed to be characterized by great
deliberation; as though there was nothing to fear, and no
occasion for haste.  The larger vessels were especially slow
in their movements, and felt their way along in the most
cautious manner, each one being guided or piloted by two
or more torpedo boats, which kept a good distance in
advance, and sounded the channel carefully and constantly,
indicating by signals the course for the larger vessels to
pursue.  There was no haste, no confusion, no noise or
cheering, and no apparent notice was taken of the balls
and shells with which the antiquated guns on the forts on
Long and Staten Islands,&mdash;with much noise and banging,
but no harmful results,&mdash;managed to splash the water about
half a mile or a mile away from anything that they were
aimed at.  Most of the smaller vessels gathered together
near the point of Sandy Hook, with the evident intention
of anchoring in the Horseshoe.  Here the first real fighting
took place.  Some old wooden gunboats, (relics of the
War of the Rebellion) had been hastily repaired and equipped
with one or two guns; and had been stationed in the Horseshoe
to act as a sort of a harassing or observing force.  The
intention had evidently been for them to watch the
movements of the enemy from behind the shelter of Sandy
Hook, possibly exchanging a few shots with some of his
weaker vessels; and then, having acquired some knowledge
of his movements and intentions, as well as a taste of his
quality, to retire up the harbor, and join the remainder of
the American fleet in the Upper Bay.  They acquired
much more knowledge than they bargained for; and, instead
of a mere taste, they got a surfeit of the enemy's quality.
</p>

<p>
As the first large iron-clad&mdash;the "Camperdown,"&mdash;came
within range, they opened fire on her from their eight-inch
guns.  Having to fire across the land (Sandy Hook) their
first shots went away over the "Camperdown," and the
shells exploded harmlessly in the shallow water miles away
near the Coney Island shore.
</p>

<p>
The gunboats sat so low in the water, that their crews
were obliged to elevate their guns considerably, so as to have
the projectiles go clear of the land.  This, of course, sent
them away over the vessels at which they were aimed; and
although the low point of Sandy Hook afforded them
protection against the guns of the British, it also prevented
their own guns from being of any service.  This attack,
however, seemed to spur the British Admiral into counter-action.
A vigorous exchange of signals was made between
various members of the fleet, and in a short time several
of the torpedo boats and smaller armored cruisers ran close
in, by Sandy Hook, and running up past the point and
around into the Horseshoe, brought the American gunboats
into plain sight, and point blank range.  Of course
the result of the contest between these modern iron-clads
and the antiquated wooden tubs of the Americans, was a
foregone conclusion, and in less than fifteen minutes from
the time that the first gun was fired, the latter were
disposed of in the most summary manner.  One sank where
she lay, her wooden hull having been perforated from stem
to stern with the projectiles fired from two rapid firing
machine guns on one of the British gunboats.  Another
one was disabled by a huge ten-inch shell, which struck her
nearly amidships, and literally blew her all to pieces.  The
third one sought such safety as she could, by running
aground, and her crew, having first set her on fire, took to
their boats, and rowing ashore, disappeared in the thick
cedar forest which covers this part of Sandy Hook.  No
appreciable loss or damage was inflicted upon the English
vessels&mdash;all but one of which proceeded quietly to anchor
in the Horseshoe.  This one steamed rapidly out to the
Flagship, communicated the result of the action to the
Admiral, and received orders to escort the remaining
smaller vessels of the fleet to the sheltered anchorage
which had been so quickly and easily won.  The merchant
cruisers, "Umbria," "Etruria" and "City of New York"
also anchored in the Horseshoe.  Shortly after these vessels
had anchored, fire was opened upon them from an earth-work
on the Highlands of Navesink, which had been hastily
thrown up, and mounted with five or six old smoothbore
Dahlgreen guns.
</p>

<p>
A few well aimed shells soon drove the men away from
this battery, and although on occasional shell was sent in
that direction at intervals during the remainder of the day,
the Dahlgreens were thenceforward dumb.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the balance of the fleet, consisting of the
larger iron-clad battle ships and cruisers, had anchored in
the Swash Channel, in a line extending nearly a mile and
a half southeasterly from the point of intersection of the
Swash with the Main Channel, near buoy fourteen.  This
position had evidently been previously selected by the
English Admiral as the best one outside of the Narrows; which
were supposed to be thoroughly protected by torpedoes and
other submerged obstructions.  Nothing had as yet been
been of the American fleet.  It was known to be assembled
in the Upper Bay; but it seemed strange that it should thus
permit the enemy to establish himself in a position of his
own choosing, without any hindrance or opposition.
</p>

<p>
The position was a remote one, it is true; but, still, if
the enemy's guns had a range as claimed&mdash;of over eleven
miles,&mdash;a very large part of New York, and nearly the whole
of Brooklyn, were within reach of his shells.  There has
never, so far as I can learn, any satisfactory reason been
given for this strange lack of action on the part of the
Americans.  The only plausible explanation of it lies in the
fact that they appreciated the vast disproportion between
their own fleet and that of the enemy, and realizing the utter
hopelessness of attacking the latter successfully by daylight,
and on equal terms, determined to husband such strength
as they possessed, and concentrate the whole of it in the
night attack upon the English, which had been determined
upon.
</p>

<p>
Thus it happened that the afternoon of the 11th of May
passed quietly and uneventfully, save when the silence was
broken by the distant reports of the guns from the Staten
Island forts, or by the occasional shelling of the abandoned
earthwork on the Highlands.  Towards sundown a sort of
a reconnaisance was made in the direction of the Narrows by
three torpedo boats; but, as they approached within closer
range of the guns of the forts, they abandoned their purpose
without reaching the first line of submerged obstructions.
One of them was disabled by a solid shot from Fort Richmond,
and was towed back to the Horseshoe by her two
consorts in an apparently sinking condition.  As nightfall
approached, there was an evident increase of excitement
and activity on all the English vessels.  Torpedo boats and
steam launches, darted hither and thither from one of the
anchorages to the other, evidently conveying orders and
instructions for the coming night.  Torpedo booms and nets
were placed in position, and elaborate instructions were
issued to each separate commander what to do in case of
attack&mdash;steam was kept up on all vessels, and the electric
search lights were thoroughly tested, so as to leave no doubt
of their being in perfect order.  Every preparation which
experience or ingenuity could suggest, was made to resist
any attack, no matter what its character might be, and no
matter whence it came.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in the memory of living men, there
were no harbor lights lighted that night.  Orders had been
given by telegraph to all the different light-house keepers
not to light their lamps, for fear that the enemy might
want to make some movement by night, which the lighthouses
would aid him in accomplishing.  So from Sandy
Hook to Bobbin's Reef, in the Upper Bay, not a light was
to be seen, except such as was shown by the English vessels.
</p>

<p>
As soon as darkness set in, the firing both from the
forts and from the ships ceased; and an utter stillness fell
upon the scene, broken only now and then by the shrill
whistle of some boatswain, or the hoarse murmur of some
loud-voiced petty officer, giving orders to the watch on
duty.
</p>

<p>
This quiet condition of things continued until after
midnight.  At one o'clock A.M. all the light-houses in the
harbor were lighted simultaneously, and the surprised
Englishmen saw themselves surrounded with stationary and
revolving lights, from Sandy Hook and the Navesink Highlands
on the south, to Cheesequake and Princess Bay on the
southwest and west; Elm Tree and Toad Hill on the north-west,
and the Narrows and Robbin's Reef in the distant
north.
</p>

<p>
A hasty consultation of their charts convinced them that
these were merely the regular light-houses of the harbor;
but if so, why had they not been lighted earlier?  Evidently
their darkness all the evening, and their simultaneous
lighting at this late hour, proved that instructions had
been given to their keepers in advance, and if so, must
have been given with some object in view.  So guns were
fired, and signals were exchanged, and orders were given
to the whole fleet to prepare for instant action, and the
whole surface of the Lower Bay seemed to be illuminated
as if by magic, by the powerful electric search lights which
were turned in all directions, making everything plainly
visible almost to the horizon.
</p>

<p>
A faint sound, as of the distant rushing of waters, was
heard in the direction of the Narrows, and the word was
passed quietly from officers to men: "They're coming
now, boys.  Look sharp; and be ready for them."  It was
the last of the ebb tide, and aided by it the American fleet
made rapid progress down the bay.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, to the great bewilderment and dismay of
the English, a vast number of powerful electric lights
seemed to spring out of the water in almost every direction
around them.  These were nearly as powerful as the search
lights on their own vessels; and dazzled the eyes of the
British so completely, that their search lights were rendered
comparatively useless.  Presuming, of course, that each of
these was on board of a vessel, and therefore represented
something to be destroyed, the English commenced blazing
away with their guns, both great and small, directing
them against these lights.
</p>

<p>
"I had no idea the beggars had such a big fleet," said
the British Admiral to an officer standing near him on the
dock of the flagship.  "Why there must be nearly two
hundred of them.  But they must be small things, or we
would know all about them.  We have a list of every ship
in their navy up to last winter, and all told, there were less
than forty, so I don't fear them much."
</p>

<p>
If the admiral had only known then, what he discovered
later on, he need have had still less fear of these lights,
and moreover, might have saved a vast amount of valuable
ammunition which was needlessly wasted; for these
powerful lights, instead of proceeding from the deck or spars of
hostile ships, were nothing more than decoy lights on long
spar buoys, whose lower ends being loaded, permitted them
to float upright with the tide, with about half their length
out of water, thus raising the lights about fifteen to twenty
feet above the surface of the bay.  The lights were fed by
powerful storage batteries, and had been turned on as they
had been launched overboard from two swift little torpedo
launches about a mile up the bay.  The tide being ebb,
carried them quickly down to where the enemy's fleet lay at
anchor, and the latter, almost before they could realize
their position, found themselves, as they supposed, in the
midst of the American fleet.
</p>

<p>
These "Blinding buoys" as they were called, were one
of the numerous ingenious devices which had been called
into existence by the supposed approach of war.
</p>

<p>
They served their purpose of blinding and confusing
the enemy admirably; and if the Americans had only had
force enough to have enabled them to take advantage of
the fright and confusion they occasioned, the result of the
conflict would have been very different from what it was.
When we consider however, the very limited means at their
disposal, it will be seen that they accomplished results
which seem well nigh incredible.  The time of launching
the "blinding buoys" had been carefully chosen, so as to
utilize them for the longest possible period.  The idea was
to have them reach the anchored vessels about a quarter of
an hour before the tide turned, so that they would remain
among them as long as the slack water ebb lasted.  So the
Englishmen kept blazing away at them for nearly half an
hour, without either inflicting any damage, or discovering
their fraudulent character.  In the noise and confusion, it
became impossible to signal the other vessels of the fleet;
and the wisdom of issuing detailed orders in advance was
now apparent.
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of these orders, the "Etruria," and
"Umbria," and "City of New York," and several of the
other unarmored cruisers, slipped their cables, and ran
quietly out to sea.  The smaller gunboats, at anchor in the
Horseshoe, extinguished all their lights, and gave no
indication whatever of their presence.  But the torpedo boats
hastened to the scene of battle, eager to come to the assistance
or the rescue of their more formidable consorts.  And
it was one of these, which first discovered the fraudulent
character of the "blinding buoys."
</p>

<p>
This boat&mdash;the "Terror"&mdash;having fixed upon one of
these electric lights as her own especial prey, made a dash
for it, with the idea of affixing a torpedo to it, and
blowing it skyward.  Nearer and nearer it came&mdash;its dazzling
brilliancy illuminating every part of the deck of the little
vessel, whose officers and crew stood with bated breath,
waiting for the crash which would indicate that their prey
was within their reach.
</p>

<p>
"Now!  Lookout!  Hold fast!  Here she is!"  Every
man braced himself and grasped some portion of the vessel
nearest to him;&mdash;the rail&mdash;a stanchion&mdash;a rope&mdash;anything
to steady himself by, until the force of the collision should
have spent itself&mdash;when&mdash;behold! the light disappears
under the bow; and reappears a moment later, swaying
wildly from side to side, a dozen yards or more astern.  There
is no crash&mdash;no collision&mdash;no shock&mdash;no tangible thing
against which to launch the waiting torpedo; only an
exclamation by the man who had been quietly waiting for the
proper moment to launch his deadly missile, of&mdash;"Well!
I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d!"  That was all.
</p>

<p>
The true character of the buoys having been thus
discovered, no time was lost in conveying the information to
the nearest of the large ships; which immediately ceased
firing, and endeavored to signal her consorts to do the
game.  Owing to the smoke, however, it was some time
before she could make her signals understood; and just
she did so, an immense explosion took place under her
side, which seemed almost to lift her, (monster though she
was) out of the water; a shivering and crashing of
machinery and iron work ensued, and the rushing waters
poured into her hull, through a vast yawning chasm, which
the dynamite shell had made in her side.  She sank in
about fifteen minutes&mdash;the first victim of Zalinski's
dynamite gun.  Most of her crew were rescued; although quite
a number went down with her.
</p>

<p>
By this time, the smoke had cleared away, and the
search lights were again beginning to be of some service,
because the flood tide had commenced running, and had
carried the buoys away in towards Staten Island.  The
lights enabled the English to discover several vessels;
among which was the dynamite gun boat "Vesuvius,"
whose maiden effort had been so successful.
</p>

<p>
The slanting muzzles of her three guns could be plainly
seen projecting above her deck; and their attendants were
evidently getting them ready for another discharge.  Two
fast gun-boats, armed with rapid firing four-inch guns,
were signalled to attack her, and disable her at
once&mdash;which they proceeded to do with great promptness and
despatch.
</p>

<p>
The vessel herself withstood the onslaught fairly well;
but the muzzles of the long guns being entirely exposed,
they were soon rendered useless; and the commander of
the "Vesuvius," seeing that her usefulness was ended,
sought safety in flight up the Bay.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the numerous torpedo boats were rushing to
and fro, now and then succeeding in exploding a torpedo in
the vicinity of one of the larger English vessels; but more
frequently kept at a safe distance by the torpedo booms
and nets.
</p>

<p>
The submarine boat "Destroyer," succeeded in
partially destroying two iron-clads before she met destruction
herself.
</p>

<p>
As this occurred in a most unexpected and curious
manner, I will give an account of it, while describing the
battle; although the particulars as to the manner of her
destruction were not known until long after the conflict
was over.  She had successfully exploded large torpedoes
directly under the bottoms of two of the English ships;
completely disabling one, and nearly sinking the other;
and had retired to a short distance from the scene of
conflict, where she lay partially submerged, evidently preparing
to attack the "Camperdown," one of the most formidable
vessels of the fleet.
</p>

<p>
After a delay of about a half an hour, she was seen to
start in the direction of the "Camperdown," and shortly
before reaching that vessel, to disappear under water;
presumably to go under her great adversary's bottom.
</p>

<p>
This was the last that was seen of her.  The panic and
excitement on the "Camperdown" was intense, as the
officers and crew waited minute after minute for the
inevitable crash, which would in all probability, sink their
vessel, and involve the majority of themselves in certain death.
But notwithstanding the suspense and terror which possessed
them, not a man left his post, or refused to obey the
orders of his superiors.  The whole crew was mustered on
deck, the boats were manned, life belts distributed among
the men, crews were told off to each boat; and in a grim
and deathlike silence they awaited the shock which would
be the signal for them to leave their vessel, and trust
themselves to the mercy of the waters.  But they waited in
vain.  The shock never came.  The "Destroyer" not only
failed to destroy her vast antagonist, but failed also to
re-appear herself on the surface of the water.
</p>

<p>
"Something must have happened to her!" exclaimed
the American admiral, who was watching her movements
with a night glass, as well as the smoke and the uncertain
light from the search lights would permit, from the bridge
of the "Baltimore," his flagship, which was manoeuvring
around about two miles up the harbor.
</p>

<p>
"Something" indeed had happened to her; but it was
not until several weeks afterwards that anybody knew
exactly what it was.  Then divers found her "standing on
her head," with her ram so deeply imbedded in the muddy
bottom of the bay, that it required the united efforts of two
or three of the most powerful derricks in the harbor, to
extricate her.  When she was finally brought to the surface,
the dead bodies of her crew were found on board of her.
They had evidently tried in vain to open the manhole, and
take the desperate chance of getting out, even in the face of
the inrushing water, in preference to the certain death from
asphyxiation, which otherwise awaited them.  Their efforts
for some reason had been unsuccessful, and the supply of
fresh air becoming exhausted, they had evidently died from
suffocation.
</p>

<p>
As yet, the American cruisers had taken no part in the
struggle.  They were unarmored, and their guns were of
comparatively short range; and it would have been folly
for them to have attacked their heavily armored and armed
opponents.  The three American turret ships, however, had
at length come within range, and opened fire from their
revolving turrets upon the Englishmen.  The heavy balls
from their smoothbore guns seemed to have but little effect
on the thick armor coating of the English ships; and as
they could only fire at each revolution of the turret, their
fire was as slow, as it was ineffectual.
</p>

<p>
Moreover the turrets soon proved utterly inadequate to
resist the tremendous penetrating power of the heavy
English guns, and were either absolutely perforated by the
shot and shells; or else were so bruised and battered and
jarred and jammed, that they could no longer be revolved
on their carriages, and became utterly useless.
</p>

<p>
The most complete and phenomenal success on the
American side, however, was achieved by two insignificant
looking little boats which involved an entirely new&mdash;albeit
a very simple&mdash;principle of marine warfare as applicable to
Harbor defense.  These boats had been built by private
subscription as experiments, at a cost of about $50,000 each.
Their inventor had appealed in vain to Congress to authorize
the construction of at least thirty or forty of them, which
he claimed would be amply sufficient to protect all of our
principal seaports, at an aggregate cost of about $2,000,000;
or less than that of a single first class iron-clad war vessel.
His idea was strongly backed up by the Secretary of the
Navy, who urged Congress to make an appropriation for the
purpose of testing it thoroughly.  When, however, the inventor
explained to the members of that intelligent and brilliant
body, that the principle upon which he based his invention
was that of self-destruction; and that to use his craft in
actual warfare, was to destroy it, these back country
gentleman, whose sole idea of statesmanship seemed to be limited
to posing and shouting like howling dervishes before the
shrine of what they called "economy," posed and shouted
more violently than ever; and holding up both hands in
holy horror, had exclaimed: "What! waste two millions
of the people's money on things that are good for nothing
without you destroy them?  Never! never!  Let us rather
reduce the terrible taxes which now burden our struggling
and poverty-stricken people; or if the surplus must be spent,
let us put it in the rivers and harbors and public buildings
of the country;" and straightway the appropriations for
those admirable purposes were doubled, and the hare-brained
inventor packed off from Washington with a very large sized
economical flea in his ear.
</p>

<p>
He had, however, at length succeeded in impressing some
wealthy New Yorkers with the value of his invention, and
sufficient money had been raised to build two boats, according
to his plans.  These boats being intended for harbor
defense only, did not need to be especially seaworthy; nor
did they require large quarters for crew, or much space for
fuel.  Consequently, nearly their whole interior could be
occupied by engines and boilers; thus ensuring them a speed
which approximated thirty miles an hour.  They were
propelled by twin screws, and could therefore turn around in
nearly their own length.  They carried no arms or ammunition
of any kind, except a gigantic tube or cartridge,
containing two tons of dynamite, which was carried in a hollow
place left for the purpose in the long steel ram, with
which their bows were armed.  A full crew for one of these
boats consisted of eight men&mdash;two engineers, four firemen,
and two pilots, one of whom acted as deck-hand when
required.
</p>

<p>
These men had been carefully selected from the marine
militia, and for several weeks had been drilling constantly
in the upper and lower bays.  The drill was a peculiar one,
and consisted simply of running at high speed for a mile
or so; then, at the stroke of a bell, the four firemen would
rush on deck, and leap over-board; a few moments later, at
the sound of a second bell, one engineer, and one pilot
would follow them; and lastly, just as the headway of the
boat began to slacken, the remaining engineer and pilot
did likewise, striking out, and swimming away from the
boat, as rapidly as they could.  Being provided with cork
jackets, they had no difficulty in sustaining themselves
until they were picked up by a steam launch, which always
accompanied them as a tender, and on which they would
rejoin their abandoned boat, which by that time would be
drifting lazily about with the tide, a mile or so away.  The
men had become thoroughly accustomed to this service, and
enjoyed it vastly, although the summer was backward and
the water was cold.  These boats were also arranged with
large water tanks, which when filled, brought them very low
down in the water.  Their roofs were a sort of combination
of dome and turtle back, composed of four-inch steel plates.
</p>

<p>
Thus, when submerged to their "fighting depth," they
offered but a small target as they approached the enemy,
and if a shot or shell should strike them, it would in all
probability glance off without injury, owing to the angle
at which it would strike.  An electric wire led from the
pilot house to a clock-work arrangement, attached to a
percussion cap, which communicated with the two tons of
dynamite in the hollow bow of the boat.  The problem was
simply to rush at the broadside of the opposing vessel from a
distance of a couple of miles or so, and as soon as possible, to
give the engineers and firemen the signal to jump overboard.
Then, the pilots having remained at their post until they
were certain that the boat would strike the enemy, to fasten
the wheel amidships, with lashings provided for that
purpose, touch the button communicating with the clock-work,
jump overboard and swim for their lives during the
seventy or eighty seconds in which the clock arrangement
was doing its deadly work; and then, after the tremendous
explosion, which would blow both their own and the enemy's
vessel into a thousand fragments, to float quietly about
until picked up by their tender.
</p>

<p>
In was a perfectly simple and feasible thing to do, and
in this, its first trial in actual warfare, it worked to a charm.
</p>

<p>
The "Victoria," the largest and most formidable of the
turreted ships, and the "Camperdown," the largest of the
armored ships, were the two vessels selected for the two
experimental dynamite rams to operate against.
</p>

<p>
These rams bore the suggestive names of "Suicide" and
"Samson."
</p>

<p>
The smoke having partially cleared away, the position
of the two English ships could be accurately determined, and
the two small rams at length received the expected signal
to proceed to the attack.  Making a circuit of about a mile,
to get under good headway, they headed straight for their
respective victims, and rushed towards them at a frightful
rate of speed.  They were followed at a considerable distance
by their respective tenders.  Their presence was soon
discovered by the aid of the electric search lights, and a
severe fire was opened on them from all the British vessels
within range.  Owing to their peculiar construction, this
fire had little or no effect upon them; and they continued
their headlong race towards the two giant ships, lying
quietly at anchor in fancied security.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly several figures were seen to rush wildly astern
and jump overboard.  But still the rams kept up their
tremendous speed, and were pointed directly at the amidship
section of the two iron-clads.  Nearer and nearer they
came, in spite of the deadly and continuous firing from the
enemy's guns, both great and small, which seemed utterly
impotent to check their progress.  At last, when they were
within a couple of hundred yards or so of the iron-clads, each
blew a short sharp single blast with its whistle, and two
men were seen to run aft, and roll down the inclined surface
of the turtle-backed roof of each ram, into the water.  The
rams themselves kept on, however, and a collision was seen
to be inevitable.  Orders were given to the English crews
to hold themselves in readiness to repel boarders.  But in
vain!  The tireless little rams rushed onward&mdash;madly,
wildly, triumphantly, gladly&mdash;to their own destruction;
but to the destruction also of their enemies.  A jar, a
sound&mdash;not so very loud&mdash;of snapping bolts and crushing
iron plates; a sound of confused voices, saying: "She has
struck us," "She has gone half way through us!" a few
instants of comparative silence,&mdash;during which the officers
consult hastily as to what had better be done.  An order or
two given in quick sharp tones; and then&mdash;with a mighty
rumble and flash; with a frightful tossing and splashing of
the water; with a thunderous roar, and a soul sickening
shiver, which seemed to impart itself even to the sea, the
two great ships, and their two little adversaries met a
common fate&mdash;being both blown to atoms&mdash;and disappeared
forever beneath the waves.
</p>

<p>
The loss of life was terrific on the two English ships;
as most of their crews went down with them; but a few
were rescued by boats, which were quickly lowered from the
remaining vessels of the fleet; and quite a number were
picked up by the launches, which were acting as tenders to
the two rams, and gathering up their swimming crews.
These latter had diminutive electric lights on their caps,
and having turned these on, as soon as they jumped
overboard, were easily discovered and picked up.
</p>

<p>
The effect of these tremendous explosions of dynamite
was demoralizing in the extreme, to the English officers and
crews: and although the attack was not pressed by the
Americans, the order was given, to such of the fleet as
remained, to hoist anchor, and proceed out to tea.  It was
now nearly daylight, and at six o'clock that morning (May
12th) the telegraph operator at Navesink Highlands
telegraphed to the N.Y. Associated Press, as follows:
</p>

<p>
"British fleet all apparently lying at anchor just outside
the bar.  Three or four of the largest iron-clads missing.
They are supposed to have been captured or sunk in the
battle last night.  The distance is too great to distinguish
those which remain; but there seems to be considerable
activity among the smaller vessels; and the launches are
moving about from one ship to another, as if for consultation,
or giving or receiving orders.  The fleet is probably
repairing damages, as far as possible, before proceeding to
sea.  It is supposed here that they will sail direct for
Halifax for repairs and refitting."
</p>

<p>
This despatch was published in extra editions of all the
newspapers in New York and Brooklyn; and, taken in connection
with the accounts received from the officers and crews
of the American fleet, which had returned to its anchorage
in the upper Bay after the fight was over, and which united
in describing the affair as a complete and glorious victory,
it occasioned great rejoicing in those cities.  Cannon were
fired, flags were hoisted, thanksgiving services were held in
many of the churches, and the citizens testified their delight
and satisfaction in the wildest and most extravagant manner.
</p>

<p>
To add to the public excitement, and to intensify, if
possible, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people, despatches
arrived from General Schofield, to the effect that he had met
a large body of the enemy, and had not only repulsed their
attack, but had put them completely to rout and captured
several thousand prisoners; and the flying remnants had
been pursued by his cavalry to the St. Lawrence River,
opposite Montreal.
</p>

<p>
So much simultaneous good news was decidedly exhilarating;
and it is not to be wondered at, that pandemonium
seemed to have broken loose in New York and Brooklyn
that evening.
</p>

<p>
Bonfires were lighted; fireworks were set off; improvised
torchlight processions made night hideous with their
cheers, and drums and fifes, and cannon firings; and banners
and transparencies, in which poor old John Bull was shot,
and stabbed, and drawn and quartered, and in many other
ingenious and hitherto unheard of ways, put an end to for
ever and ever, were to be seen in every street.
</p>

<p>
In one of these, Ireland, represented as a broad shouldered,
strapping young woman, with a suspiciously rubicund
countenance (especially about the tip of her nose), dressed in
green silk&mdash;<i>decolleté</i>&mdash;had thrown her brawny arms around
the neck of Uncle Sam, who obligingly bent over, half way
across the Atlantic, to permit this trans-oceanic caress.  This
transparency was wildly cheered, and was followed by a
tremendous crowd of shouting and yelling men and boys,
until the candles went out, and the bar-rooms closed for the
night.
</p>

<p>
The newspapers of the 13th of May, in all parts of the
country, indulged in the wildest jubilations, and the
"croakers," who had theretofore called attention to the
weakness of the American navy, and the defenseless condition
of American seaports, were ridiculed and abused in the
most unmeasured terms throughout the length and breadth
of the land.  American ingenuity was lauded to the skies,
as being equal to every emergency, and able to bid defiance
to all the antiquated Old World methods of war-making.
The American Eagle&mdash;never a very modest bird&mdash;flapped its
wings, and screamed in a manner which put to shame its
most extravagant previous efforts in that line.
</p>

<p>
In England the situation was exactly reversed.  The
French cable had of course carried the news of the British
defeat to Paris; and from them it had been wired to London,
with such additions and exaggerations as French unfriendliness
to England could suggest; and London was in an
uproar.  Lord Randolph Churchill was burned in effigy in
various parts of the city and country, and a general chorus
of "I told you so's," coupled with estimates of the cost in
pounds, shillings and pence, of the destroyed fleet, went up
like a National wail, from one end of Great Britain to the
other.  Bonfires were lighted on every hill-top in Ireland,
and the streets of Dublin and Cork were fairly green with
millions of Irish flags.  The continental newspapers,
especially the German and French ones, all contained labored
articles, giving various accounts of the battle, and paying the
highest tribute to the inventive genius of "those wonderful
Americans," and condoling with England in rather a sarcastic
vein upon her loss of prestige as a naval power.  For a
wonder, the French and German journals had at length a
subject upon which they could agree, and they seemed to
vie with each other in the publication of articles in which
their intense hatred and jealousy of England, was but thinly
disguised, under the most polite expressions of sympathy
for her fall from a place among the highest, to a position
among the third or fourth-rate powers of the world.  The
immediate dissolution of the "so called British Empire"
was spoken of as a matter of course, and while it was generally
conceded that Australia would be able to maintain itself
as an independent power, the probable fate of British India
was a subject upon which these writers displayed for three
or four days, the customary combination of ignorance and
ingenuity, for which the continental press of Europe is to
justly renowned.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE RETURN OF THE FLEET.
</h3>

<p>
On the 13th and 14th of May, there was a thick fog,
which rendered it impossible to see anything at a greater
distance than a few yards.  It did not extend more than a
mile or two inland, but shrouded the whole coast in an
impenetrable darkness.
</p>

<p>
The rejoicings and congratulations still continued in
New York and Brooklyn; but in a diminished degree.
Even patriotism requires breathing spells, and the citizens
were fairly worn out with their celebration.
</p>

<p>
A quiet air of cheerful contentment, under which was
plainly evident a feeling of serene self-satisfaction, had
replaced the boisterous and exuberant manner of the
previous two days; and when the sun rose clear and bright on
the morning of the 15th of May, aside from the
super-abundance of American flags, which gave the city a
holiday look, there was nothing to indicate any unusual
excitement.
</p>

<p>
Although the weather was perfectly clear in the city,
the fog still continued very thick in the lower bay, and
outside of Sandy Hook, so that until nearly noon, when it
began to clear away, nothing could be seen from the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
About noon, however, despatches began to arrive from
the operator there, describing the gradual lifting of the
fog.
</p>

<p>
"11.45 A.M.  Fog lifting slowly.  Sandy Hook now
plainly visible.
</p>

<p>
"11.55 A.M.  Scotland Lightship now in sight.  Several
coasting vessels lying near her at anchor.  Nothing else in
sight.
</p>

<p>
"12.10 P.M.  Sandy Hook Lightship now visible.  Several
vessels lying near her.  Impossible to make out just
what they are.  Weather still hazy.
</p>

<p>
"12.30 P.M.  British fleet evidently not all gone yet.
Probably waited for disappearance of fog.  Forty or fifty
large and small vessels lying near the Lightship."
</p>

<p>
"1.15 P.M.  Smoke now issuing from the funnels of
several of the fleet.  They are evidently about to get under
way."
</p>

<p>
"1.30 P.M.  A small vessel, evidently a gun boat, is now
steaming rapidly in towards Sandy Hook.  She probably
desires to communicate with the shore; but shows no flag
of truce as yet."
</p>

<p>
"2 P.M.  British gunboat referred to in last despatch
has just passed Sandy Hook, and is now heading up the
Swash Channel at somewhat reduced speed."
</p>

<p>
"2.45 P.M.  Gunboat, after stopping and apparently
examining the battle ground of the 11th, now steaming
slowly up towards the Narrows."
</p>

<p>
These despatches attracted considerable attention in the
city, and when they appeared in the evening papers, there
were numerous surmises as to the reasons for the return of
the English gunboat.  Not much attention was paid to the
matter, however.
</p>

<p>
And now, in order to render this narrative as brief and
explicit as possible, I will quote from the official report of
the British Admiral, as the best and most reliable authority
as to the occurrences of the next few days.
</p>

<p>
"After the severe action on the night of the 11th,
which resulted in the loss of three of our most formidable
ships, and the serious crippling and disabling of several
others, as hereinbefore described, I deemed it advisable to
withdraw from the outer harbor to an anchorage near the
bar, to gain time for consultation with the officers of the
fleet, as well as to ascertain exactly the amount of damage
we had sustained, and our remaining effective force
available for a renewal of hostilities.
</p>

<p>
"At daybreak on the 12th, the fleet, much scattered,
was all outside the bar; some of the commanders having
either from an excess of caution, or a misunderstanding of
orders, proceeded so far out to sea, that recall signals could
not reach them.  By nine o'clock, however, they had all
returned within call, and were anchored in the vicinity of
the Sandy Hook Lightship.  This vessel lies about eight
miles E. by S. from Sandy Hook, and although in heavy
Easterly or Southerly gales, the position is a very exposed
one, yet in ordinarily fair weather, such as is usually had
hero in May, it is a perfectly safe anchorage, especially for
steam vessels with banked fires.  A council of the flag
officers of the fleet was called to meet on the flagship at
1 P.M.
</p>

<p>
"At this meeting, detailed reports of the condition of
each vessel were made; and to my great satisfaction, I
discovered that the 'Sansparei,' although two of her
compartments were full of water, and her main engines were
disabled, was entirely unhurt&mdash;so far as her armament was
concerned; and that if she could reach a position where
her guns would be effective, was as formidable as ever for
offensive purposes.  The 'Howe' had also had a hole knocked
into her by a torpedo; but the damage was not such as to
interfere with her effectiveness in the slightest degree.
The damages to the other vessels were trifling, and interfered
neither with their motive nor their fighting powers.
</p>

<p>
"The absolute destruction of the 'Victoria' and
'Camperdown' by the enemy, by means of self-destroying torpedo
boats, and the complete inability of our other vessels to
defend themselves against similar attacks, had been the
cause of my withdrawing the fleet beyond their reach.
And the first question to be discussed and decided, related
to the probability of a similar attack being made upon us
in case we returned to the harbor.  If the enemy had a
force of these self-destroying torpedo boats, equal in
number to the vessels composing our fleet, it would be simple
madness to undertake further hostilities.
</p>

<p>
"These boats were swifter than our swiftest ships; and
were so large and heavy that they could go right through
our torpedo nets and booms, and pierce the hulls of our
ships far below the water line; and the thorough manner
in which they had blown the 'Victoria' and 'Camperdown'
to pieces, had convinced me that nothing afloat could
withstand their destructive efforts.  Indeed I have since
learned that there were two tons of dynamite in each
discharge&mdash;an amount sufficient, if properly directed, to lift
the heaviest vessel ever built, bodily out of the water.  It
was, therefore, of vital importance to us, to find out, if
possible, whether the enemy had any more of these boats, and
if so, how many; and for that purpose I called a council of
officers, in the hope that some of them might have more
definite knowledge on the subject than I had.
</p>

<p>
"During this council, the opinion was expressed by the
commanding officer of the converted merchant cruiser, 'City
of New York,' that he had some men on board his ship
who knew something about it, and at my request he went
on board his vessel to make inquiries.  He returned shortly,
bringing with him an assistant engineer, who had been
employed on the 'City of New York,' when she was engaged
in the merchant service between New York and Liverpool;
and after considerable objection on his part&mdash;although
he was a Scotchman, and not an American&mdash;he admitted
that on one of the last voyages of that vessel, he had
visited Philadelphia, and had seen the two self-destroying
torpedo vessels on the stocks, in the shipyard of the
Messrs. Cramp, in that city.  They were unfinished then, and
regarded more in the light of curiosities than anything else.
The Government did not even own them; but they were
being built by private parties for experimental purposes;
and were the subject of much ridicule among the workmen.
He explained the principle upon which they were to
operate.  A hollow ram at the bow contained an enormous
charge of dynamite, which was connected by an electric
clock-work arrangement, with the pilot house, and was to
be exploded by the pilot after he had run her into the hull
of the hostile vessel; the pilot and the crew jumping
overboard with life-preserving suits on, and taking their
chances of being picked up after the explosion.
</p>

<p>
"This description tallied so exactly with the manner in
which the 'Victoria' and the 'Camperdown' had been
destroyed, that the conclusion was irresistible, that it was
the work of these two experimental vessels; and that (there
being no more of them; or, the enemy being out of ammunition,
so to speak) there was really nothing to prevent us
from renewing our attack at the earliest possible moment;
towing the 'Sanspareil' and the other disabled vessels to
a point where their guns would be effective for
bombarding purposes.
</p>

<p>
"It was therefore decided to send a swift gunboat in to
reconnoitre the lower bay early the following morning;
and if her report was favorable, the whole fleet was to follow
her in, and take a position as far up the harbor as was
practicable.  A dense fog prevented any action being taken
until the second day afterwards&mdash;the 15th.  On that day,
about noon, the fog lifted, and I sent the 'Orlando' in to
reconnoitre, and instructed her commander to push forward
towards the Narrows, until stopped by torpedoes or other
obstructions, or until the fire from the forts became too hot;
when he was to return to the fleet and report.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile the remainder of the fleet got under way and
with the 'Sanspareil' and 'Howe' in tow of the 'Umbria'
and 'City of New York,' proceeded slowly towards Sandy
Hook.  By 3.30 P.M. we had reached the point where the
battle of the 11th had been fought.  There were no signs
of the enemy in sight below the Narrows; but the reports
of heavy guns, and the smoke over Staten Island and Long
Island showed that the forts on both sides of the Narrows
had opened fire on the 'Orlando.'
</p>

<p>
"I ordered the fleet to anchor, partly in the Swash, and
partly in the main ship channel, and hoisted the recall
signal for the 'Orlando.'
</p>

<p>
"Owing to the smoke or the distance, or both, her
commander failed to obey the signal, and kept exchanging
shots with the forts; so I sent a despatch boat up the bay
with peremptory orders for her return.  About 5 o'clock
she came down, and anchored with the remainder of the
fleet, and her commander came on board the flagship, and
reported verbally that, he had proceeded up the main ship
channel to the Narrows.  That he had drawn the fire of
the forts on both Long Island and Staten Island; and had
developed the fact that the guns were old-fashioned smooth
bores, which would have little or no effect upon our heavily
armored vessels.  That several of the large solid
shot&mdash;apparently ten inch&mdash;had struck his armor belt, near the
water line, without inflicting any damage beyond making a
deep indentation; and that several torpedoes had exploded
near his vessel, but none directly under her&mdash;therefore he
could not report as to their efficacy.  With a good stout
ship, however, properly divided into water-tight compartments,
he thought he could safely defy any obstructions or
torpedoes that might be placed in the Narrows; and in
response to the direct question, whether he thought it was
feasible to take the fleet into the Upper Bay, answered
unhesitatingly in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"In consequence of this information, but more
especially as I was already in a position to shell the lower part of
New York City, and nearly the whole of Brooklyn, I issued
the following proclamation, which I sent up that evening
by a despatch boat, under a flag of truce, to the City:
</p>

<p>
"'To the Mayors and Citizens of New York and
Brooklyn:
</p>

<p>
"'As Admiral commanding Her Britannic Majesty's
Expeditionary fleet, I hereby give notice that at 12 o'clock
noon, on the 18th day of May, 1890, the bombardment which
I am ordered to inflict upon the cities of New York and
Brooklyn will be commenced.  While I deeply regret the
painful necessity which compels me to be the agent in such
a terrible destruction of life and property as this bombardment
will involve, yet my orders are peremptory; and I
shall, to the best of my ability, obey them to the letter.  I
can, however, postpone the evil day; and instincts of
humanity would impel me to do so, even if they were not
re-inforced by my own personal wishes in the matter.  In
order, therefore, that non-combatants,&mdash;and especially
women and children&mdash;may be removed to a place of safety,
I give this public notice, more than two days in advance of
the bombardment.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE PANIC AND FLIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
The publication of the foregoing proclamation in the
late editions of the evening newspapers of New York and
Brooklyn, on the evening of its issue (May 15th), occasioned
the wildest excitement and terror in those two cities.  At
first, many of the inhabitants regarded it as a cruel hoax,
and utterly refused to believe it.  They had been so
thoroughly convinced that the British fleet had been practically
annihilated on the night of the 11th, and had yielded
themselves up so completely to the current feelings of joy and
triumph at the supposed success of the American fleet, that
they could not seem to realize that their rejoicings had been
premature; and that, although partially destroyed, the
British fleet was still formidable enough to carry out its
instructions, and bombard New York and Brooklyn.
</p>

<p>
The transition from joy to terror was too sudden to be at
once comprehended in all of its force.  The streets and
squares uptown were crowded all the evening, and late into
the night; and wherever there was a newspaper bulletin, or
a transparency, thousands of excited men and woman congregated
in the hope of getting the latest news.  It is safe
to say that but few people slept any that night, in either
city.  Even the doubters and unbelievers tossed sleeplessly
in their beds, anxiously watching for the coming of day;
or else remained up all night, packing their clothing and
valuables, so as to be ready to start on short notice, in case
remarkable proclamation, should prove to be genuine.
All doubt upon this point, however, was set at rest the next
morning.
</p>

<p>
All of the newspapers contained the Proclamation of the
British Admiral, and supplemental ones by the Mayors of
the two cities, calling the attention of the inhabitants to
the imminent peril; and advising all non-combatants to
seek places of safety without delay.  The news columns of
the newspapers also contained full details of the movements
of the hostile fleet, and the astounding fact was made
manifest beyond question, that British guns were even then in
positions from which they could shell the two cities.
</p>

<p>
After the first momentary paralysis which these
announcements occasioned, the whole population was seized
with a wild panic.  An irresistible desire for immediate
flight seemed to possess them in a moment, and a scene
began which beggared description, and whose like has
probably never been seen before or since.
</p>

<p>
"Anything to get uptown or out of town," seemed to
be the cry.
</p>

<p>
Husbands who had gone to business as usual, early in
the morning, telephoned to their wives and children to
meet them at High Bridge, at the Grand Central Station,
or at some of the landing places of the steamboats going
up the Hudson River.  The Sound boats were tabooed, by
reason of a rumor that the attacking fleet had been divided
into two sections, and that one division was coming through
Long Island Sound to attack the city from the Hell Gate
side.
</p>

<p>
By ten o'clock on the morning of the 16th of May, the
flight had fairly commenced.  Frantic crowds of men,
women and children, thronged every possible avenue of
departure from the doomed cities, and pushed and pulled
and struggled and wrestled with each other, in their wild
and headlong rush to reach their several points of escape.
The streets leading to the Grand Central Station in
Forty-second Street, were blocked for nearly half a mile in every
direction, by carriages, cabs, and express wagons, as well
as by hurrying and anxious pedestrians, all rushing pell
mell to get beyond the reach of the terrible bombshells.
</p>

<p>
Many amusing tales were told as tending to illustrate
the absolute and unreasoning terror of the fugitives.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?" inquired the railway ticket seller of an
excited and pale faced man, whose hands trembled violently
as he handed a roll of bills in through the ticket
window.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Anywhere!  Albany; Buffalo; Chicago; Denver!
Anywhere to get beyond the reach of those d&mdash;d
shells," was the trembling response.  The train service was
doubled and quadrupled.
</p>

<p>
Passengers took no thought as to whether or not they
could secure seats; but packed themselves in like sardines,
filling the aisles and closets and platforms of the cars to
suffocation.  The entire passenger equipment of the road
was called into requisition, and utterly failed to supply the
demand; and milk, freight, and ordinary platform and
gravel cars were pressed into the service; and the crazy
fugitives absolutely fought each other for precedence in
securing positions on them.
</p>

<p>
Similar scenes were enacted at all the railway stations
and steamboat docks.  The "Mary Powell," a passenger
steamboat, which then ran every afternoon up the Hudson
River to Rondout, was obliged to leave her slip more than
an hour before her regular starting time, simply because
the people could not be prevented from forcing themselves
on board of her, even after she was dangerously overcrowded.
</p>

<p>
Numerous excursion steamboats were pressed into the
service, and the most exorbitant prices were paid for tugs
and launches, or craft of any kind, on which persons could
reach places of comparative safety up the river.  Similarly
all sorts of wheeled vehicles were pressed into the traffic;
and the east and west drives of Central Park were crowded
with hurrying fugitives of both sexes, and of all ages and
conditions, in public and private carriages, cabs, hansoms,
omnibuses, butcher carts, dumping carts, and grocery and
express wagons.  Even hearses were utilized as a means of
escape; and the mad prank of a lot of Columbia College
students, shocked a great many people, and amused a great
many more.
</p>

<p>
These young men, desiring to go out of town in style,
went to a fashionable undertaker's establishment, and
hired his handsomest hearse and four of his best horses,
and having fitted up a lot of seats on top of the hearse,
and supplied themselves with two or three coaching horns,
drove wildly up through Central Park to Yonkers, waking
the echoes from one end of the route to the other, with the
shrill notes of their horns, and attracting universal
attention to this novel style of a four-in-hand drag.
</p>

<p>
Anything that had wheels to run on, and horses to draw
it, was eagerly snapped up at the most exorbitant price.
The hegira was something unprecedented, and almost
incredible.  It was estimated at the time, that not less
than 500,000 persons left the city between the hours of
noon and midnight, on that memorable sixteenth of May.
Of course there was a vast amount of inconvenience and
suffering involved in such a hasty invasion by such a horde
of people, of a country totally unprepared to receive them;
and thousands of cases of illness and death resulted from
the exposures and discomforts to which the fugitives
were subjected.  It was also the occasion of many ludicrous
and embarrassing incidents, which were fully described in
the newspapers in the racy and sensational style so
prevalent at that time.
</p>

<p>
I have ample material in the shape of extracts and clippings
from those journals, to make a chapter which would
be both thrilling and amusing to the reader.  But I forego
the introduction of such matter here, lest it should be
deemed too trivial in its nature, to be incorporated into a
sober and truthful historical work like this.
</p>

<p>
The exodus continued, but in diminishing proportions,
throughout the two following days; until by noon of the
18th (the time fixed upon for the commencement of the
bombardment) there remained probably less than 100,000
people in the two cities of New York and Brooklyn.  Those
who remained, were either unable from illness or some similar
cause, to get away; or else they had determined, through
curiosity or indifference to consequences, to remain and
"see the thing through."  But their members were so few,
that they merely emphasized the magnitude of the exodus
which had taken place.
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon the announcement of the intended
bombardment, the Sub-Treasurer had telegraphed to Washington
for instructions.  There were in the Sub-Treasury
vaults gold and silver coin and bullion, amounting to nearly
$300,000,000.  In case of the capture of the city, this would
be at the mercy of the British; and as they had practically
announced money to be their chief object in coming across
the Atlantic, it was not at all probable that they would fail
to snatch such a rich booty as this.  What, therefore, was to
be done?  A Cabinet meeting decided to order the removal
of this vast amount of treasure to a place of safety; and
instructions to that effect were telegraphed to the Sub-Treasurer,
who was also authorized to demand a suitable Military
escort from the force of regulars, which had been hurriedly
summoned to New York as soon as war was declared.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, the Sub-Treasurer at once set about securing
transportation for the gold and silver.  The proportions
were about one-third gold and two-thirds silver; and the
total weight of the two metals was found to exceed 5,000
tons.  It was found almost impossible to secure men and
teams enough to transport this enormous amount of metal.
The flight of the inhabitants had taken so many horses and
trucks from the lower part of the city, that it was found
necessary to telegraph to all neighboring places; and
Newark, and Elizabeth and Staten Island, and the nearby
portions of Westchester County, were scoured for horses or
ox teams, or any thing that could draw a load of money.
There were heavy trucks and brewery wagons in abundance,
which had been deserted for lighter vehicles by their owners
and drivers, so that the only imperative need was animal
power to drag the loaded vehicles.
</p>

<p>
The supply of horses, mules, and oxen having been
exhausted, it was necessary to fall back on men, and the
strange spectacle was seen of a procession of heavily loaded
trucks and beer wagons being dragged up Broadway from
Wall Street to the Thirtieth Street freight station of the
N.Y.C. and H.R.R.R., by long lines of men, pulling
drag ropes, in the same manner as had formerly been
the method of dragging fire engines and hook and ladder
trucks to fires.  A large number of freight trains were
accumulated here by the railroad company, into which the
gold and silver were stowed; and then, with a strong
military guard on each car, the cars were made up into trains,
and taken up the river to Albany.
</p>

<p>
A very large proportion of those who remained in the
city, belonged to the idle and criminal classes, and this
fact soon made itself apparent in the sudden breaking out
of what might be called an epidemic or carnival of crime.
Numerous incendiary fires occurred, and hundreds of
residences, which had been abandoned by their owners and
tenants in their mad flight, were broken into and rifled of
their valuable contents, by troops of thieves and tramps,
who seemed to rise out of the ground, as it were, by magic;
and were so numerous and so bold, that they bid utter
defiance to the over-worked police.  During the days of
the bombardment, these outcasts of society, would lounge
around Central Park, out of reach of the exploding shells,
which were creating such havoc in the lower portions of
the city, and then at night-fall, when the fire from the fleet
slackened, they would organize themselves into little
supper parties, and deliberately break into any private
residence whose imposing exterior happened to strike their
fancy, and proceed to make themselves at home.
</p>

<p>
As long as the bombardment and the armistice lasted,
the aristocratic regions of Fifth Avenue and Murray Hill,
resounded nightly with the songs and shouts of these rough
and drunken revellers of both sexes, who seemed never to
tire of their unaccustomed surroundings, and exhibited the
most remarkable diligence and perseverance in searching
for mansions (as yet undisturbed) whose larders and
wine-cellars were liberally stocked.  These little parties were
sometimes broken up by the police; but probably less than
half of them were interrupted in this way; as they were so
numerous in all parts of the city, and the police were so
thoroughly over-worked and exhausted, that it was impossible
for them to afford anything like adequate protection to
the property of the absentees.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE BOMBARDMENT.
</h3>

<p>
During the interval between the return of the British
fleet, on the 15th of May, and the time fixed by the
Admiral for the commencement of the bombardment, an
active interchange of messages had been going on by cable
between the Governments of the United States and Great
Britain.  Inasmuch as the minister of each power had been
recalled from the other's capital, this intercourse could
only take place through the British and American
ambassadors at Paris.
</p>

<p>
Protests against the inhumanity and barbarity of bombarding
a defenseless city, were met by propositions for a
settlement of the whole dispute.  Great Britain offered to
cede Canada to the United States, and conclude a definite
treaty of peace, and withdraw her fleet from American
waters at once, provided the United States would pay the
sum of £300,000,000 sterling (about $1,500,000,000).
This proposition was met with a howl of indignant rage,
by the Senators and members of Congress from the Western
and Central States; and the old and almost forgotten cry
of "Millions for defense; not one cent for tribute!" was
resuscitated by these back-country orators, and used with
as much dramatic effect as though it had never been
uttered before.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in the history of the country, parties
seemed about to divide, on entirely new sectional lines.
Heretofore it had always been the North against the South.
Now it was the seaboard against the interior.  The
Pacific Coast States joined with the Atlantic and Gulf
States in advocating a settlement, even on the harsh terms
proposed by Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
They pictured the enormous destruction of property
which the bombardment of all our principal coast cities
would involve, and although they conceded the truth of the
assertion of their opponents in the debate, that there could
be but one ultimate result to the war, if fought to its
natural termination, and that Canada was practically ours
already, yet they claimed that as a mere matter of dollars
and cents, it would be cheaper to pay even fifteen hundred
millions of dollars, than to go on with the war; when
the enormous amount of property involved, and the vast
extent of Canadian territory to be overrun, were taken into
consideration.
</p>

<p>
The orators from the west, however, took the high and
lofty ground of "millions for defense, etc.," and numerous
propositions were made to establish navy yards at various
points in the interior, on navigable rivers a hundred miles
or more from the coast, and also on the great Lakes; thus
indicating that their authors had an eye to the "main
chance," and were willing to vote for the "old flag and an
appropriation," provided the appropriation was to be
expended in their own states.  The debate waxed hot, and
it was with the greatest difficulty that several personal
encounters among the members and senators were prevented.
</p>

<p>
A member from one of the so called "Granger States"
even went so far as to intimate that he would rejoice to see
these soulless monopolists and capitalists of the eastern
cities brought down a peg or two.  They had for years
been sapping the foundations of the country's prosperity
by vast combinations of capital; and had levied extravagant
tolls on everything that the farmers of the Great West
bought and sold, thus increasing the cost of their living,
while diminishing the product of their labor.  Of course
he was not unpatriotic enough to rejoice at beholding a
foreign foe upon American soil; nor did he anticipate
any such result from the present war; which would certainly
end by establishing the stars and stripes as the sole
National Emblem of the North American Continent.
"Nevertheless, while we of the Great West send our
brawny sons and brothers to the battle-field to wrest a
portion of its ill-gotten territory from the so-called British
Empire, it is not too much to expect our friends In the
East to bear their proper share of the burdens of the contest.
Patriotism has its responsibilities and its duties, and
these frequently involve the sacrifice of life and property;
and I would be the last man to deprive my eastern friends
of one iota of the patriotic satisfaction which they will
experience, when some of their ill-gotten gains are sacrificed
on their country's altar,"&mdash;and a lot more rubbish of the
same sort.
</p>

<p>
To which a New York member replied, by making sarcastic
allusions to the "honest Grangers," who he said
had for years been going down on their knees and begging
the capitalists of the great eastern cities, to send their
money west and invest it, in railways, water-works,
gas-works and other public improvements; or to lend money
to western farmers on their farm mortgages; and then, as
soon as they had fairly gotten the money out there, they
had invariably tried to steal it&mdash;or to confiscate it through
forms of law&mdash;which amounted to the same thing.  They
passed laws limiting the price of gas and water to such low
figures that many of the gas and water companies were
bankrupted; they organized state boards of Railway
Commissioners who assumed to fix passenger and freight rates
at figures which would scarcely pay operating expenses; and
having discovered that several hundreds of millions of
dollars of eastern capital had been advanced on what were
known as "farm mortgages," at rates of interest varying
from seven to twelve percent., passed usury laws fixing the
rate at not to exceed six per cent., and also passed laws
exempting a farmer's house and barns from sale under
execution.  It is true, this last law had been decided to be
unconstitutional, but it only showed the lengths to which
the "honest" agricultural toiler would go in his efforts to
get something that did not belong to him.  "Why sir!"
continued this metropolitan statesman, "Who supports
our confidence men?  Visitors from the country, who want
to play a 'skin game' where they think they have a 'sure
thing.'  How do our 'green goods' men find their
customers?'
</p>

<p>
"By mailing their circulars, offering to sell well executed
counterfeit money at ten cents on the dollar, to 'honest'
tillers of the soil in all parts of the country.  Show me a
man who is constantly prating about the 'tyranny of capital,'
and the 'grinding of honest toilers' by corporate greed
and individual usury; and I will show you a man who is at
heart a scoundrel and a knave; and who will never pay
even a just debt, if he can sneak out of it."
</p>

<p>
Of course these speeches were entirely foreign to the
subject under discussion, but I introduce these brief extracts
merely to show to what extent sectional feelings and
prejudices ran, as well as to explain to a certain extent, the
almost incredible failure of Congress to act promptly, and
prevent the vast destruction of property which the
bombardment of our seaport cities would involve.
</p>

<p>
These discussions were continued day and night (for
Congress sat in almost continuous session) from the 15th
to the 18th, without any result being arrived at.  The
members and senators were flooded with letters and
telegrams from all threatened points, begging them to act at
once; to pay the indemnity demanded; take Canada, and
bide our time for a final settlement with Great Britain.
But owing to the objections of the Western and Central
States, nothing could be accomplished, and when the sun
rose on the morning of the 18th of May, it was a foregone
conclusion that New York and Brooklyn were to suffer all
the horrors of a bombardment, unless (as was highly improbable)
the British Admiral should see fit to further extend
the time of probation.  This he utterly refused to do; and
having on the two previous days silenced the forts on Long
and Staten Islands, and easily repulsed a feeble attack by
the unarmored cruisers "Atlanta," "Baltimore," "Boston"
and "Philadelphia," and a score or so of torpedo boats, he
prepared, on the morning of the 18th, to force his way
through the Narrows into the Upper Bay, where he would
be within easy range of the two cities.  He had satisfied
himself that the torpedoes, with which the Narrows were
supposed to be thickly planted, would not be able to
prevent his fleet from passing through.  Many of these
torpedoes had been cut loose and destroyed by his torpedo
destroyers; and the officers of these little boats assured him
that they had cleared a narrow channel, which they had
marked with diminutive buoys; and that if he would take
his fleet in, in single file&mdash;each vessel following as closely as
possible in the wake of the one immediately preceding
her&mdash;the whole fleet could unquestionably pass through
without damage.
</p>

<p>
This suggestion was adopted, and before 10 o'clock on
the morning of the 18th, the whole British fleet, with the
exception of the "City of New York," was safely riding at
anchor in the Upper Bay.  The "City of New York" was one
of the merchant steamships which had been metamorphosed
into a cruiser.  She had formerly been plying in the
passenger trade between New York and Liverpool.  Owing to the
shortsighted policy which our Government had previously
adopted in refusing to aid or encourage the establishment
of American steamship lines; this ship, although her owners
were Americans, had been built in England, and sailed under
the English flag in order to secure the subsidy of £10,000 a
year, which that Government agreed to pay for the privilege
of turning her into a cruiser in time of war.
</p>

<p>
Thus, when war was declared, the American owners of
this vessel and the "City of Paris," had the mortification of
seeing their own property taken from them, to make war
upon their own country.  In attempting to enter the
Narrows with the rest of the fleet, the "City of New York,"
owing to her superior speed, could only keep her place in the
line with great difficulty, and in sheering off, to avoid a
collision with the vessel just ahead of her, she ran out of the
channel which had been buoyed by the torpedo destroyers,
and getting directly over two large torpedoes, she was
partially blown up, and sunk in the deepest part of the Narrows
in about a hundred feet of water.
</p>

<p>
Her destruction caused great rejoicing among all classes
of Americans, who had protested loudly but vainly against
this unpatriotic use of the British flag.  But after all, the
owners of the vessel were not so much to blame for it as
Congress was.
</p>

<p>
As the fleet proceeded up the Bay and came to anchor
between Bedloe's and Governor's Islands, its movements
were watched with intense interest by a large crowd, which
had assembled on the seawall of the Battery.  As the hour of
noon approached, however, this crowd thinned out rapidly;
and at twenty minutes of twelve o'clock&mdash;at which time it
had been announced that the trains on the elevated railways
would cease running,&mdash;there were not more than a dozen
persons visible along the whole water front of the Battery.
At ten minutes before twelve, a shudder of apprehension
ran through the few remaining denizens of the two cities,
as they heard the ominous boom of a heavy gun.  It was,
however, not immediately followed by any others; and as
was subsequently ascertained, was only a blank cartridge,
fired as a preliminary signal to the rest of the fleet, to hold
themselves in readiness to commence firing, in ten minutes.
It was like the preparatory gun before starting a regatta.
Everything was apparently to be done in exact accordance
with a programme previously agreed upon; and the
bombardment was to commence with true "man of war"
precision and ceremony.
</p>

<p>
To us of the present generation, who have never experienced
any of the horrors of war, it seems almost incredible
that civilized and Christian men, could thus coldly arrange
the details of the destruction of life and property on such
a vast scale, and calmly count the seconds on their watches
as they ticked away the few remaining moments which
separated the two great cities from destruction.
</p>

<p>
Promptly at noon, the guns on the portside of the flagship
flashed the signal to the rest of the fleet, and the
work of destruction commenced in earnest.  The fire at
first seemed to be directed against the tall buildings in the
lower part of the city, which were in plain eight, and
afforded excellent marks for the gunners.  But as these
became rapidly battered down into masses of ruin, the
guns were elevated a little, so as to throw the shells
further uptown, and the area of destruction was thus vastly
widened.
</p>

<p>
During the first day's bombardment, there seemed to
be a tacit understanding among the artillerists (probably
the result of a general order on the subject) to spare the
Brooklyn Bridge; and although many projectiles came
very near to the towers and supporting cables, and some
almost grazed the structure itself, yet it remained intact on
the evening of the 18th.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 19th, however, when the
bombardment was renewed, these orders (if any such had
existed on the previous day) had evidently been countermanded,
foe nearly the whole fire of the fleet seemed to be
concentrated on the towers and the cables, and in less
than half an hour after the opening of the second day's
cannonade, the massive granite towers gave way, and the
whole magnificent structure fell into the river beneath,
where for many months it remained an absolute barrier to
navigation through the East River and Long Island
Sound.
</p>

<p>
The Brooklyn Navy-yard was also thoroughly riddled
during the second day.  The British gunners had evidently
been studying their charts over night, and had gauged the
distance and direction of the yard so exactly, that before
noon of the 19th, they had thrown over five hundred
shells into the yard itself, or its immediate vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Nearly everything inflammable took fire and was consumed,
and all of the buildings in the neighborhood were
more or less damaged.
</p>

<p>
One rather amusing feature of the bombardment
occurred here.  A Mr. Higgins had an immense soap
manufacturing establishment almost adjoining the Navy-yard
and (with the ingenuity and enterprise, which then,
as now, seemed to characterize that particular industry in
the invention of novel advertising devices) had erected on
his premises a gigantic fac-simile of a soap box, the sides
of which being transparent, were brilliantly illuminated
at night with powerful electric lights.  This box, being
elevated on an iron frame-work more than 100 feet high,
made a most striking and conspicuous display, plainly
visible for a long distance up and down the East River, and
was unquestionably very successful as an advertisement.
One of the first shells which was intended for the Navy-yard,
went crashing through this counterfeit soap box on
the morning of the 19th, shivering it to atoms; and as a
matter of course, putting an end to its career as an
advertising device.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, affairs in the business and residence quarters
of the two cities were in a deplorable condition.  Fires
were raging in every direction, caused by the exploding
shells, and although the police and firemen stood their
ground bravely, and were most efficiently aided by such
troops of volunteers and militia as still remained in town,
their efforts were entirely futile in staying the progress of
the flames; and it seemed as though any further bombardment
would be a mere waste of ammunition; as such
portions of the cities as had not been already shattered by
the shells, seemed doomed to certain destruction by fire.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the lower portion of New York was a confused
heap of ruins.  The palatial business structures, many
of which rose to an enormous height, and which had been
such a source of pride to the citizens, had all been demolished,
and the streets in the lower portion of the city were
rendered almost impassible, by the debris which lay scattered
about in confused piles throughout their entire length.
The numerous safe deposit vaults, which occupied the
basements of many of these mammoth structures, were buried
so deeply, that several week's excavation were required
before they once more became accessible.
</p>

<p>
In short, the destruction was about as complete as it
could well be, and the British Admiral could at least have
the satisfaction of feeling that he had carried out his
instructions to the very letter.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE ARMISTICE AND TREATY OF PEACE.
</h3>

<p>
About 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th of May,
the torpedo boat "Stiletto" was sent down from Yonkers,
where the American fleet was lying, with a flag of truce,
requesting a cessation of hostilities, pending some fresh
negotiations between the two governments.  The exact
nature of these negotiations was not known to the officers
making the request; but their representations were such
as to induce the British Admiral to accede to their wishes,
(especially as he had already done about all the damage
that he could) and an armistice for ten days was agreed
upon.
</p>

<p>
It subsequently transpired that news had been received
in Washington that the two other British fleets, which
were intended to operate against the New England, and the
Southern Atlantic and Gulf seaports, had sailed on the
15th of May for their respective destinations, and might
be expected to arrive on our coast about the first week in
June.  This announcement, coming simultaneously with
the demonstration of the utterly defenseless condition of
our coast cities, which the bombardment of New York and
Brooklyn had so conclusively shown, caused such a
universal chorus of indignant protest throughout the whole
country, that the senators and congressmen, who had
previously opposed all propositions looking to a settlement of
the controversy by the payment of a war indemnity, began
to fear that a persistence in their course might cost them
their official positions; and several announced their
willingness to change their votes, in case the question could be
again brought up.  With these accessions, however, the
measure still lacked a majority; and in all probability
would have failed of passage, if it had not been for the
shrewd and ingenious invention of a Boston journalist,
who published a detailed description (said to have been
received from a Canadian deserter) of four formidable
iron-clad gunboats, which were said to have been conveyed
in sections, by rail, from Montreal to a place called
Collingwood, on Georgian Bay, with the utmost secrecy, during
the preceding summer and autumn; and which were now
nearly ready for action, and within two or three weeks, or a
month, at the most, would bombard all of our lake cities,
from Duluth to Buffalo.
</p>

<p>
This story subsequently proved to be a complete fabrication;
but it served its purpose admirably; for the senators
and congressmen from all the States bordering the Great
Lakes, hastened to announce themselves as favorable to a
compromise, on any reasonable basis.  Now that the
enemy was knocking at their own doors, and pressure was
brought to bear on them by their own constituents, they
seemed to view the situation from an entirely different
standpoint from the one which they had formerly occupied;
and unanimously "flopped" over to the "peace at any
price" party, as the advocates of settlement, had been
contemptuously christened by their opponents.
</p>

<p>
An act was rushed through both houses of Congress,
authorizing and directing the President to appoint three
commissioners to confer with a like number to be appointed
by the government of Great Britain, to draft a treaty of
peace between the two countries, in substantial accordance
with the terms heretofore offered by the representatives of
Her Britannic Majesty's government.
</p>

<p>
A further cessation of hostilities, pending the meeting
of these commissioners in Paris, took place, and the two
British fleets then on their way to the United States were
instructed, by cable, to rendezvous at Halifax, and await
further orders.  The negotiations were concluded much
more promptly than such negotiations usually are.  The
only serious question of difference grew out of the insistence
by the British commissioners, that the United States
should assume the indebtedness of the Dominion of Canada.
</p>

<p>
This was at length agreed to by the American
representatives, and a treaty of peace, which was subsequently
ratified by both governments, was agreed upon, by which
Great Britain ceded to the United States all of its Canadian
and West Indian possessions, except the island of Barbadoes,
which was to be retained as a military and naval station;
and in return for this cession of territory, the United
States agreed to assume the indebtedness of Canada,
amounting to about $300,000,000; and to pay to Great
Britain, as "purchase money," $1,500,000,000.  The phrase
"purchase money," instead of "penalty" or "war indemnity,"
was inserted at the urgent request of the American
commissioners, without serious objection by their British
associates.  The latter, doubtless, thought that as long as
they got the money, it made no difference what name they
gave it.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended one of the briefest, and at the same time one
of the most momentous wars that ever was waged.  Its
brevity was obvious.  Its importance grew out of the fact
that it changed the Nationality of half a continent, and
totally revolutionized existing methods of Naval warfare.
England's triumph, it is true, was complete; and British
jubilation was intense, but both were only temporary; and
this apparent success was but the commencement of the
downfall of the British Empire.  That heterogeneous
combination of different races and Nationalities, had hitherto
"ruled the world" by virtue of its conceded superiority as
a naval power; but this American invention of self-destroying
torpedo boats, having fully demonstrated the fact that
any properly defended harbor was invulnerable to attack
even by the heaviest and most formidable iron-clads, British
threats ceased to alarm anybody; and thenceforward
England exerted only such influence in European councils, as
her military strength entitled her to&mdash;which was very
trifling.
</p>

<p>
In the great Continental war which made such radical
changes in the maps of Europe and Asia, she took
practically no part; and while Germany absorbed German
Austria, and thus realized the dream of Bismark's life&mdash;German
unity,&mdash;and Vienna became in name, as well as in fact, a
German City; and while Russia seized the Danubian
provinces and European Turkey and Greece, thus possessing
herself of Constantinople, and of her long coveted outlet on
the Mediterranean; England was compelled to look idly
on, and play the rô1e of a disgusted spectator.
</p>

<p>
To the loss of prestige as a Naval power, which the
Battle of the Swash occasioned, can also be directly
attributed England's subsequent loss of India and Australia; the
former by Russian conquest, and the latter by declaring
itself an independent nation.
</p>

<p>
Thus do the most momentous historical events often-times
hinge upon apparently trivial happenings; and the
fate of Nations and peoples yet unborn, may be changed by
a skirmish of outposts, or the bombardment of towns on
the opposite side of the world.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
The treaty of peace was greatly objected to by such of
the Canadians as had favored a continuation of British
rule, and the more bitter of these attempted to organize
an "Independence party."
</p>

<p>
Their numbers, however, were comparatively insignificant,
and although they made a show of organizing an
army for the purpose of opposing the United States troops,
and achieving the independence of Canada, they took good
care not to risk a conflict with the vastly superior forces of
the Americans, and in less than a month, such of them as
had not deserted, surrendered; and all further traces of
opposition to American occupation disappeared.  On the
4th of July, 1890, which was the one hundred and fourteenth
anniversary of American Independence, the United
States took formal possession of Canada; and the
prosperity of that vast section of the North American
Continent may be said to date from that eventful day.
</p>

<p>
The war now being concluded, and the questions which
had for more than a century proved so vexatious, being
permanently settled, the people of the United States had
plenty of leisure time to count up the cost of the
"economy" which their rulers had been treating them to, ever
since the end of the Civil War.
</p>

<p>
As has already been shown, these demagogues, while
prating about the surplus, and the tariff, and the
down-trodden laboring man, and the crime of spending the
people's money for anything but river and harbor and public
building jobs, and exorbitant premiums on immature
bonds; had permitted the United States Navy to go to
decay, from motives of "<i>economy;</i>" had utterly refused to
offer even decent rates of compensation for the carrying of
foreign mails in American ships, for the sake of "<i>economy;</i>"
had declined to encourage the establishment of an
auxiliary naval force, by the payment of an annual rental
for the privilege of employing swift American built
steamships as cruisers in time of war, because by not doing so,
the treasury would save $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 a year,
and these statesmen could continue to pose before the
country as champions and apostles of "<i>economy;</i>" and
had neglected year after year to fortify the seaboard cities,
notwithstanding the constant and oft repeated warnings
uttered by military and naval experts, intelligent and
thoughtful writers, and farsighted statesmen of both political
parties; because, forsooth, when year after year the
River and Harbor Bill and the Public Buildings Bill had
been inflated to the largest possible figures that would be
likely to escape a presidential veto, they found that they
could not spend any money on fortifications without
exceeding the appropriations made by their predecessors,
and would thus render themselves liable to be considered
by their constituents as lacking in the great essential
element of "<i>economy</i>."
</p>

<p>
Well, these economical statesmen had had their way&mdash;and
their day&mdash;and their constituents and <i>masters&mdash;the
People of the United States</i>&mdash;said to them, "Gentlemen,
render an account of your stewardship.  Let us see what
your loud professions of 'economy' for the past twenty-five
or thirty years amount to.  Let us have an itemized
account, debit and credit, and see how far your acts have
been justified by results."

"There are other items, gentlemen, which could easily
be made to swell the above debit balance; but these are
sufficient.  You may step down and out.  The people of
the United States are the most wealthy and liberal people
in the world, but ten years more of such "economy" as
yours has been, would bankrupt us.  We wish you no harm,
gentlemen, but we have no further need of your services."
</p>

<p>
Of course this monologue is not to be taken literally,
but it is what the people of the United States practically
said, by their action, at the elections which succeeded the
Battle of the Swash.
</p>

<p>
It is, perhaps, needless to remark, that for many years
subsequent to 1890, American statesmen were not called
upon to wrestle with the difficult problem of "how to
dispose of the surplus revenue."
</p>

<p>
Their "economical" predecessors had effectually
obviated all necessity for any such discussion; but the
lesson which the people had learned, was a most valuable
one, and instead of considering themselves the suffering
victims of an excessive and burdensome system of taxation,
they fully realized that they were the most favored people
in the world in that respect, and cheerfully supported the
new generation of Congressmen in authorizing the liberal
expenditures, which in a few years made our coasts and
harbors invulnerable; gave us a navy superior to that of
any other nation, and placed us once more in the van
among the maritime powers of the world.
</p>

<p>
At the first glance, the Battle of the Swash seemed to
have been a most disastrous event for the United States.
</p>

<p>
England got all the glory and all the money, and the
United States got Canada and&mdash;<i>the experience</i>.  But the
latter proved to be worth infinitely more than it cost, in
that it exploded the absurd system of miscalled "economy,"
which only "saved at the spigot to waste at the bung."
</p>

<p>
Let us rejoice that in this year of grace 1930, we have
so profited by the errors of our ancestors, that we now
occupy unchallenged, the foremost position among the
Nations of the earth; and that with our 200,000,000 of
intelligent, prosperous and contented citizens&mdash;each one a
sovereign in his own right&mdash;we can afford to look with
indifference upon the wars and struggles of our less fortunate
contemporaries on the other side of the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
Too late, alas! had the truth and wisdom of these
words&mdash;written by that great founder of the Government, Thomas
Jefferson&mdash;become manifest.
</p>

<p>
"Our navigation involves still higher consideration; as a
branch of industry it is valuable; but as a resource of
defense, it is essential.
</p>

<p>
"The position and circumstances of the United States
leaves them nothing to fear from their land board, and
nothing to desire beyond their present rights.
</p>

<p>
"But on the seaboard they are open to injury, and they
have then, too, a commerce which must be protected.
</p>

<p>
"This can only be done by possessing a respectable body
of artists and citizen seamen, and establishments in
readiness for shipbuilding.
</p>

<p>
"If particular Nations grasp at undue shares of our
commerce, and more especially, if they seize on the means of
the United States, to convert them into aliment for their
own strength, and withdraw them entirely from the support
of those to whom they belong, defensive and protective
measures become necessary on the part of the Nation whose
marine sources are thus invaded, or it will be disarmed of
its defense, its productions will be at the mercy of the
Nation which has possessed itself exclusively of the means
of carrying them, and its politics may be influenced by those
who command its commerce.
</p>

<p>
"The carriage of our own commodities, if once established
in another channel, cannot be resumed at the
moment we desire.
</p>

<p>
"If we lose the seamen and artists whom it now employs,
we lose the present means of Marine defense, and time
will be requisite to raise up others, when disgrace or losses
shall bring home to our feelings the evils of having
abandoned them."
</p>

<p>
The "disgrace and losses" incurred by our ancestors in
this brief but disastrous campaign, had indeed brought
"home to their feelings the evils of having abandoned" the
great interest thus earnestly pleaded for by the greatest
statesman of his day; and the absurd folly of the so-called
"economy," which prompted its abandonment, was at
length reluctantly conceded by the noisiest and bitterest
advocates of free trade throughout the land.

</p>

<p>
SECTION 2. All vessels now built or owned, or hereafter
to be built or owned in the United States of America, and

tons burden.
</p>

<p class="hanging">
2nd. The said vessels must have a maximum speed of

engines&mdash;exclusive of furniture and equipment for
passengers&mdash;shall also be submitted to, and approved
by, the said Bureau of Naval Construction and
Engineering, and the amount of cost, thus
approved by such Bureau, shall be taken as the
value upon which the contracts provided for in
the first section of this Act, shall be based.
</p>

<p>
SECTION 3. Upon the completion of any such vessel, and
the filing in the office of the Secretary of the Navy of certified
copies of the report of the Bureau of Naval Construction
and Engineering, approving the plans of the hull and
engines of such vessel, and also certifying that the estimate of
the cost of such vessel is not excessive; and after actual
tests of the speed of such vessel, under regulations imposed
by the Secretary of the Navy; the said Secretary shall, if
requested to do so by the owner or owners of such vessel,
enter into a contract with such owner or owners, for a
period of not less than ten, nor more than fifteen years, by
which, in consideration of the privilege of taking such
vessel by charter or purchase, at any time during the
pendency of the said contract, on ten day's notice, the United
States shall pay as an annual rental, to the owners or
agents of such vessel, interest on her cost, as certified by
the Bureau of Construction and Engineering, as follows:
</p>

States will purchase such vessel, shall be fixed at the price
approved as heretofore provided, by the Bureau of Naval
Construction and Engineering, plus a bonus of not to
exceed twenty-five per cent. of such price, to cover the
outlay for passenger equipment, and as a compensation to
the owners of such vessel for her withdrawal from her
regular employment.
</p>

<p>
Such valuation shall govern until such vessel shall have
attained the age of five years; and thereafter a deduction
of six per cent. shall be made therefrom annually, to cover
depreciation and wear and tear.
</p>

<p>
SECTION 5. In case the Secretary of the Navy shall
elect to charter such vessel or vessels, instead of purchasing
them, the rate to be paid therefor shall be five dollars
per month per registered ton; such vessel to be at the risk
of the United States during the pendency of such charter.
</p>

<p>
SECTION 6. This Act shall take effect immediately.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
